            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Popiſh Clergie having got a King of their own Religion, have inceſſantly cryed on him, that the Churches, Colledges, Rents, Revenues, Tythes, and Benefices, were of right theîrs: And that it was Sacriledge to keep them out of Poſſeſſion. The <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Clergie had the Reformation to plead, the ſad ſufferings of their predeceſſors, and the Law of the Nation, their own piety, and Moderation (as they pretended) But the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> think they have been but lately put from it by the Prelates, they had gained it by the Sword, and that <hi>Major Vis</hi> is a good Right; and they have been ſtill attempting it ſince the year 1666: And clamouring that the Nation is under a Solemn Oath by the Covenant to extirpate all others, and eſtabliſh them: So that we are brought into this preſent confuſion, only to ſatisfie the ambition and avarice of the Clergie; The Honour and the wealth is the Bone of contention, ſettled Revenues, Tythes, and forced Mantainance: and while the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates patronizeth any one of the three in Poſſeſſion of thoſe; We need expect no quiet, but take away the Bone and the Dogs will ceaſe.</p>

               <p>What he intends by this, We muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Either he intends the <hi>Quakers,</hi> his <hi>own Book,</hi> or <hi>himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he intends is the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he is greatly miſtaken, For (if we may believe Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>Patrocius</hi> was a souldier at the ſiege of <hi>Troy,</hi> and borrowed <hi>Achilles</hi> Atmour, to fight againſt <hi>Hector,</hi> by whom he was killed.

               <p>But if he intends <hi>himſelf,</hi> I wonder how he calls himſelf, the <hi>True patroclus,</hi> But it ſeems that by reading <hi>Virgils ath. Eclugue,</hi> he hath d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

confidence. If</hi> therefore I ſome times call him <hi>patroolus,</hi> ſome times <hi>our Author,</hi> and ſome times <hi>mine Adverſary,</hi> I hope my Reader will underſtand me.</p>
               <p>He begins his preface to the Reader with a jealouſie about the acceptance of his Book (not without cauſe) He had told us before in his Dedication that it could not be judged altogether <hi>ſuperſtuous,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>Hemlock of pelagianiſm,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Bulk of the <hi>Prelatick Clargie is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected:</hi> Yet fears after all this it may be called an <hi>Iliad</hi> after <hi>Homer,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore that his <hi>Babie</hi> may not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, he tells the cauſes of its producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over again, and tho he told us it was deſigned for his <hi>Patron</hi> as a Teſtimony of his gratitude for his education: Yet here it comes to be a Publict concern, and he gives us <hi>three Fathers</hi> who have beget this <hi>Monſtrous Birth</hi> upon one <hi>Mother,</hi> his <hi>Brain, Viz.</hi> The <hi>danger</hi> of this <hi>deadly diſeaſe</hi> The <hi>prximoity</hi> of it, and the <hi>readineſs</hi> of its <hi>poſſions</hi> to <hi>broach Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems he means Truth to be this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſeaſe, but it is ſo to none but ſuch <hi>pedantick Chaplines</hi> as he who gets their <hi>Bread by lies;</hi> Not is it dangerous to any but the <hi>Clergie,</hi> becauſe its <hi>followers decry their Tyths,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102472:8"/>
their Belly, their God.</hi> As for its <hi>proximity,</hi> I know no ſober man but likes their Neighbourhood, even the moderate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Teachers. And as to their <hi>Broaching of Books:</hi> This is great impudence who was troubling him? Hath he ſeen any controverſie written by the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſince the Year 1679. And now when the LORD had moved the hearts of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrats</hi> to give them a little reſpite from their ſad ſufferings; Beholld this <hi>Gladiator</hi> attacks them (and by all the lies, Forgeries, and falſe Accuſations that he can invent to defame) provokes them again to enter the Liſts in the defence of that Bleſſed Teſtimony, which will for ever ſtand over him, &amp; all ſuch forgers.</p>
               <p>And how unwilling we have been to broach Books, may appear by our long delay to anſwer this Bable: Yea, had not ſome of their <hi>Preachers at Aberdeen,</hi> and in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> vainly boaſted that it was unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable: We had not yet thought it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be noticed.</p>
               <p>The next thing that occurs, is that <hi>he accuſes the Nation of negligence,</hi> for not <hi>compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine of the Quakers</hi> with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Oh! That he or any elſe could awaken them to that diligence, and that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102472:8"/>
they would put on that Nobility com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the <hi>Bereans,</hi> and come to an impartial ſearch, not as <hi>Patroclus, Faldo,</hi> and <hi>Hicks,</hi> repreſent them, but as they are indeed, But Reader, he intends nothing leſs: For after all thy pains, except thou will implicitly allow his Character of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and take his ſenſe of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he will be ſure to Stigmatiſe thee for a Heretick. All their clamouring the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Scriptures is but a meer Jugle, its their own Gloſs they intend. <hi>Interpres lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur Litera Sacra ſilet.</hi> A little after he tells us, <hi>ignoti nulld cupido,</hi> very true, for if the principles of the diſpyſed <hi>Quakers</hi> were but well known, <hi>Patroclus</hi> Book would be hiſſed out of Doors: And therefore in the end of this Epiſtle, he ſaith, touch not, taſte not, handle not the unclean thing; ſtrange Doctrine! try, and try not; I have told you what they are, ſtop your ears and run upon them.</p>
               <p>The reſt of his Epiſtle (being all <hi>Satyr,</hi> compoſed of Railing Lies, Forgeries, and falſe inſinuations, I omit; he bringing me no better proof for them then his own confident aſſertion, or rather impudent calumny in theſe words: in a word, I ſay,

               <p>Page 4. About the end, He ſaith (after ſome

               <p>To prove this aſſertion, <hi>William Penn</hi> produceth Scripture Reaſon, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Ancient and Modern Writters. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Goſpel is the Power of GOD to Salvation: To which he anſwereth, That the Scriptures may as well be called the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of Acceptations properly and improperly, again for he hath done with it.</p>
               <p>He ſayes page <hi>5th.</hi> It was the ſame Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which the Apoſtles preached and committed to Writting, Who denyes this, or what ſaith it for him, more then <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 1.

               <p>In the next place <hi>William Penn</hi> gives him another Scripture, <hi>Rev:</hi> 14. 6.

               </p>
               <p>To conclude this Matter, he brings one Scripture, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 1. After he hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted a great untruth; and then raiſed violently upon it, <hi>To wit,</hi> That <hi>William Penn</hi> denyeth that the Books of <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> contain <hi>Glade tidings;</hi> Whereas <hi>William Penn</hi> hath three times over called them Narratives, or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Goſpel, or <hi>Glade tidings</hi> This is great Impudence but common to Men of his Coat.</p>
               <p>Then from the Scripture before cited, he bringeth forth a Dilemma, which is eaſily anſwered by a Dilemma, which is eaſily anſwered by a diſtinction betwixt the Hiſtory and the Myſtery of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which he might have conſidered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had given us all this Traſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But to let him ſee what follows upon his Senſe

He begins with <hi>R: B:</hi> his delemma, to which he anſwereth: Seeing <hi>R: B:</hi> inſinuateth, that there are an ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Revelations and, elſewhere clearly denyeth that there are any, therefore his dilemma is impertinent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now let the Reader judge what cander we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from this man who hath out done both <hi>Hieks</hi> and <hi>Faldo,</hi> they cired book and page, yet were found Forgers; He cites no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet would be truſted, let him mend this fault with the next before he produce his <hi>argumentum ad hominem,</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102472:20"/>
his abſurd and malicious conſequence upon it: Which is, that according to the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> men are not oblidged to abſtain from Murther, without ſuch an immediate objective Revelation as <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This is very diſſingenuous, did ever any <hi>Quakers</hi> pretend to give a new Law to the World, and confirm it by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as did <hi>Moſes?</hi> Or did they ever teach, That the Foretelling of things to come (as did the Prophets) was neceſſary to Salvation? The <hi>Quakers</hi> pretend to no new Revelations of new things, but to a new Revelation of the good old things, as ſhall be ſeen more hereafter; And for ſuch ſtuff it may take with <hi>Patroclus</hi> Hearers, but every Man of Senſe will deteaſt ſuch dealing.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Anſwer to this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> is yet no better; For ſaith he, <hi>Tho the Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit be of abjolute neceſſity, for ſuch a knowledge of the Scriptures whereby we may know GOD revealed in them, and have true Love and Faith, and Fear,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet he that ſhall deny that any Reader of the Scriptures, tho endued with ſound reaſon only, can diſtinguiſh betwixt Commands given to a particular people for a certain time; and theſe that hind at all

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102472:21"/>
attempted any way to prove theſe to have been the Words of B. F. But thinks the World is bound to believe him, becauſe he ſaith it, Where I leave him to rave till he bring better proof.</p>
               <p>He tells us Fourthly, That it is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to ſay that without the Operation <hi>of the ſpirit,</hi> men cannot obey the Good of their <hi>own Souls,</hi> And is ſaith he, <hi>falcem pro ligone dare.</hi> Anſwer, It ſeems the Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends an Obedience which is <hi>not for the good of Mens own Souls;</hi> And what this can be, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be either <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> or <hi>ſupererogation</hi> I am to learn. As for his Proverb; I fear if the Men of his Robe did not get the Sickle before the Spade, That is did not eat the Fruit before they planted a Vineyard, we ſhould ſee many of them with <hi>Lean cheecks,</hi> and <hi>Lank ſides.</hi> But as he hath told us before of two kinds of Knowledge, one from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> another from <hi>Reaſon.</hi> So he tells here of two kinds of Duties, one <hi>profitable</hi> for the Soul, but the other he hath not told us for what, and ſuch are many of his Duties like to be.</p>
               <p>In the fifth place he chargeth B. F. with Blaſphemie, for ſaying that it is (as he alledgeth) the greateſt Error in the World that ever was invented, and the ground of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102472:21"/>
all errour to affirm, that the <hi>Seriptures ought to be a Rule to Chriſtians:</hi> And then he tells us the palpableneſs of the Blaſphemy is an Antidote to the poiſon; and hath rendred R. B. ſpeechleſs.</p>
               <p>Well <hi>Patroelus!</hi> And is this all the proof that yet we have againſt B. F. Now three times printed without proof; And R. B. might have juſtly rejected it at firſt, and here with falls what thou brings in the laſt place, which was a ſufficient anſwer to I: B: and is yet to thee till thou clear him of theſe ignominious Epithets of Fool and Calumniator (as thou calls them) which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou nor he have ever yet attempted.</p>
               <p>But <hi>I</hi> muſt ask thee a little, What thou intends here by blaſphemy? For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the old ſignification of the Word may have been; <hi>I</hi> am ſure a Blaſphemer is now taken for a Man, who by injurious word or thought hurteth the <hi>Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty;</hi> So that except the Scripture be <hi>Patroclus</hi> God, he cannot find Blaſphemy in the foreſaid Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> All the Proof we have is, <hi>If,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the words were falſified,</hi> he was bound to have vindicated and delivered them. Here we have a new Law; if any Man call <hi>Patroclus</hi> a <hi>Thief,</hi> he is bound to prove

               <p>To conclude this particular, Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Author accuſeth the <hi>Quakers</hi> as Velifiers of the Scriptures. Yet <hi>GOD is our Witneſs,</hi> that it is far from our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but on the contrary we have <hi>a high and reverent eſteem of them,</hi> And altho ſome years agoe this Language might have paſſed for good Coyn; Yet now (Bleſſed be the LORD) we are better known both by our Principles and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not only to our Neighbours, but to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knowing Men all <hi>Brittan</hi> over, then we formerly were, So that <hi>a malicious Prieſt</hi> will not be ſo readily truſted, being a <hi>kind of men who cannot ſleep unleſs they have wounded ſome,</hi> either in their perſons or Reputations I ſhal here only deſire the Reader to ſee <hi>Dupleſſis</hi> of the Trueneſs of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> cap: 6.

               <p>And therefore to ſtop the mouth of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102472:24"/>
this Callumniator, I ſhall tell the Reader what <hi>George Kieth</hi> ſayes to obviat ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, immediate Revel: <hi>page</hi> 2. <hi>Firſt, we do not underſtand the foretelling things to come,</hi> &amp;c.

And now let the Reader judge with what candour this man hath repreſented us.</p>
               <p>Page 18 and 19. He ſaith in order to the Production of <hi>true ſaving Faith,</hi> two principles are required; Firſt the <hi>declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>object,</hi> or thing to be believed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the thing he would have me believe, is, that the <hi>ſcripture</hi> is the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and in order to this he preſents me the <hi>Bible;</hi> Iſ I ask him, how ſhall I believe this book to be the <hi>Rule of Faith and Life?</hi> He anſwereth me, <hi>the book ſaith ſo</hi> (tho there be no ſuch word in it) And this is <hi>objective Revelation,</hi> and needs no more but an <hi>application</hi> of this <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> already made. And the ſecond he calls <hi>ſubjective revelation,</hi> but he muſt excuſe me to tell him, that before he can perſwaed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102472:25"/>
me to believe that propoſition laid down in the <hi>Weſtminſter Confeſſion</hi> or <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cbiſm: Queſt:</hi> 2, that the <hi>ſcripture is the only rule.</hi>) He will need to produce me better arguments for the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (according to the <hi>Weſtminſter Confeſſion,</hi> Chap 7, Act 3) muſt be given to make men willing and able to believe, and this is more then an application.</p>
               <p>He tells us that this <hi>revelation</hi> was either <hi>mediate or immediate.</hi> Who denyes this? But I hope when it was <hi>mediate,</hi> it needed the <hi>immediate operation</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> to make them able and willing to believe, and ſo the operation of the Spirit was the Rule of this Faith whereby they chooſed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected theſe mediate <hi>Revelations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>illumination of the ſpirit</hi> is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for underſtanding of the <hi>ſoriptures,</hi> no man denyeth; But it is to be regarated that he and his Brethren take upon them to expond <hi>ſcripture</hi> to others, while they have it not, and mock and perſecute O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who bear witneſs for it.</p>
               <p>To prove ſubjective Revelation, he bringeth ſeveral Scriptures; Among others <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 46. The Words are theſe, <hi>And ſaid unto them, Tbus it is Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and thus it behooved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102472:25"/>
riſe from the dead the third day.</hi> Now the Queſtion will be, whether this was an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective, or a ſubjective <hi>Revelation;</hi> I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it to be <hi>Objective,</hi> and that CHRIST did here reveal to them things they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew before, nor had occaſion to know, albeit they might have been dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhadowed forth in the Scriptures; So that Chriſt ſpeaking to them, and at the ſame time opening their Underſtandings, both <hi>Patroclus</hi> principles concurred imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to the production of their Faith with out the Bible: Neither is he limited to Scripture words, tho he may and often does make uſe of them; And theſe words He ſpoke are not to be found in all the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> And the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not pretend to revelation of <hi>New Things,</hi> but a new Revelation of the <hi>Good Old Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider that he calls his firſt Principle a <hi>Declaration of the Object</hi> or <hi>Thing to be believed</hi> Now the Scriptures are the <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Thing to be believed;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (according to himſelf) the <hi>Declaration</hi> is neceſſary. And I muſt ask <hi>Patroclus</hi> what this Declaration is? Sure he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend nothing here but the Gloſſes, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, Paraphraſes, which he and his Brethren make upon the Scriptures,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102472:26"/>
whereby they get their Living. But if Men were but once convinced that Chriſts ſheep hear his Voice, and that his Spirit teacheth them, and bringeth all things to their remembrance whatſoever they have heard of (or from) him; Then that ſordid Trade of Preaching for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re, and Divining for money, would ſoon come to an end; And Men would ſay with <hi>Thomas a Kempis Let not Moſes and the Prophets ſpeake to me, but thou, O LORD my GOD.</hi> And with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will bear what the LORD GOD will ſpeake in me.</hi> Whereas now (pretend what they will) they are as poſitive in their dogmatiſing and no leſs angry to be contradicted then their Anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Hence it is evident, that it is their Interpretations, ſenſe and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Scriptures, which they would have to be the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Declaration of the Object.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In page 20 He makes a digreſſion, wherein he tels us the ſame things overagain; therefore I ſhal only touch ſuchthings, as, chiefly concern the matter in hand, if yet lawful for a <hi>Plowman</hi> to touch his ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms, by which that <hi>Trib</hi> have darkned Counſell with words without Knowledge: And if <hi>Patroclus</hi> be a <hi>Parochus,</hi> or Pariſh Prieſt, I am ſure the tenth man of his Hearers cannot underſtand his Terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:102472:26"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He confounds the Matterial with the <hi>formal Object,</hi> ſaying as the Scriptures hold forth other Truths, ſo they evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare and manifeſt the Characters of their Divinity; Even as the Sun proveth himſelf to be the Sun by his own ltradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and illuſtrious Beams: And this in contradiction; both to <hi>Calvine</hi> and him; ſelf. To <hi>Calvine</hi> in the place before cited; Where he ſaith, That to ſettle the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſuch a Perſwaſion is neceſſeary as needeth no Reaſons; And ſuch a ſenſe as cannot be attained but by <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> To himſelf in page 23. Where he ſaith, We being demanded, how we know the Scriptures to be the Word of GOD? We anſwer by the Teſtimony and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit. And herein he may reconcile himſelf to himſelf and his friends when he hath Leaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In page 22, ſpeaking of <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Revelation,</hi> he calls the ſpirit an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the hand of GOD: This Language ſounds not ſweetly to me, for I believe the Spirit is GOD, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot like theſe Words; GOD an Inſtrument in the Hand of GOD.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly</hi> He tells us in page 23 That <hi>ſubjective re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> is more properly called an Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102472:27"/>
then Revelation it ſelf. And yet in the ſame page he calls it the Teſtimony and Opcration of the Spirit: Now a Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony is a Witneſs bearing; And we know a dumb Man cannot be a Witneſs; But he hath told us, That the Spirit ſpeaks neither to the Ear nor the Mind, and ſo cannot bear a Teſtimony: This is palpable confuſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> page 24. He ſaith, ſo that we can Reaſon, becauſe ſurch ſpirit (<hi>v; g:?</hi>) He that confeſleth Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is ſaid by the Scriptures to be of GOD; Therefore I know and believe that is true Doctrine, and that this ſpirit is of GOD. If this Scripture be taken Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally by <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and that he intends as he Writes, I muſt confels I expected not ſo much Charity at his hands; For at this rate he accepteth <hi>Papiſts, Lutherians,</hi> yea and the <hi>Palagian Chureb of England,</hi> who all believe that Chriſt is come in the fleſh; But I will expect a Commentary upon the Words with the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In the ſame page he ſaith, We do not with the <hi>Fanatical Enthuſiſts</hi> reaſon thus; The Spirit bids me believe that ſuch and ſuch Books are the Scriptures; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I believe them to be ſo: But he hath
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102472:27"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixibly,</hi> His lame example of the Sun and Ey-ſalve is no better; He ſaith by means of the Salve he ſeeth and knoweth the Sun; And again by the Sun Light he may perceive what is Ey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſalve, and what is not: But he might have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, That tho he ſee that Sun and Ey-ſalve both, he needeth his Natural Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know the Sun, and to diſcern what is Ey-ſalve and what is not; And as in Naturals, ſo in Spirituals. <hi>No man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the things of a man, but the ſpirit of a man which is in him, ſo the things of GOD no man knoweth, but by the ſpirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> In page 26. He chargeth R. B. for calling the <hi>Weſtminſter Divines</hi> dark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Becauſe they not ſeparate the Word from the Spirit; But ſaid that the Teſtimony of the Spirit was in ant with the Word; And then reflects upon R.

Saith the in ward Illuminations and Operations of the Spirit are altogether neceſſary to beget true and ſaving, Faith in Men, and that theſe inward Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are objective, or by way of Object; Which is not very Harmonious with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troclus</hi> Doctrine of Application. And this is all the diſcovery he hath made of R: B's. Non ſuch weakneſs and extream diſingeunity, which he hath left undiſcovered till his next Printing.</p>

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:102472:28"/>And now in page 26. He ſaith, he comes directly to the Objection. Saying <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Work of the Spirit, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of which we maintain is only ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, being rather if we ſpeak properly, an Application of the things revealed in Scripture, then a Revelation of Teſtimony ſtrictly ſo taken.

He ſaith, we aſſert the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Scriptures as a Rule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all things neceſſary to be believed or done, which they deny. <hi>This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lie,</hi> For the Quakers believe the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> to be a Rule ſubordinat to the Spirit, containing a full and ſufficient Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Chriſtian Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Saith he, We believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the principal and ultimat Rule, into which our Faith is laſtly to be refolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, For anſwer to this, I ſhall only ſet down the words of one of his Brethren, <hi>Viz:</hi> The Author of that Book called <hi>Melius Inquirendum,</hi> page 303. <hi>I would ſain be informed</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>what an ultimat Rule ſignifies, with him that pretends to ſpeak plain</hi> Engliſh, <hi>to then that underſtand nothing elſe: I have heard of a ſubordinate and ultimat End; And I have heard alſo of a near and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Rule, but an ultimate Rule like that Monſter which was like a Horſe, and yet not a

               </p>
               <p>After ſome Repetitions he comes to his Citations, and begins with <hi>Luther</hi> in theſe Words; If any thing ſhould deliver any <hi>Doctrine which it could not prove by Scripture he would ſpit in its face, knowing certainly that it were the Devil.</hi> I know no <hi>Quaker</hi> but will ſay as much; Yea, I know no <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> but will ſay as much: Yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverſies are no whit leſlened by all this, becauſe they reject the Spirit by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the Scriptures can be underſtood, and without which they are a ſealed book as well to the learned <hi>Patroclus</hi> as to the unlearned <hi>Plowgh man.</hi> And here let the Reader obſerve what is become the fate of the Fathers as well as of the Scriptures, To be cited By all parties, <hi>Papiſt</hi> againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant</hi> againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and <hi>Calvine</hi> is made to ſpeak for all ends and all purpoſes: But he hath told us, that ſuch a perſwaſion concerning <hi>the authority of ſeripture</hi> is needfull, as cannot be brought forth but by <hi>Divine Revelation.

               <p>In the end of page 31, and the beginning of page 32, he ſummeth up what he hath ſaid, and hath done the <hi>Quakers</hi> a favour, that whereas ſome of his blind brethren have called them <hi>Papiſts,</hi> he hath ſet them and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> at ſuch a diſtance, as he hath left room for himſelf to hang betwixt them, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> is ſaid <hi>to have hung be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Heaven and hell:</hi> For ſaith he, page 32 The <hi>Papiſts have gone too low, reſolving their faith ultimatly in men;</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> on the other hand <hi>attempting to go too high</hi> (that is) <hi>to reſolve their Faith in GOD; Patroclus</hi> reſolves his faith in a Book, and neither in GOD nor man; Let the <hi>Reader</hi> judge which of the three is the beſt Foundation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And now we are come to his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereof the firſt is; That which was dictat or given out by the <hi>Infallible God,</hi> and containeth the whole <hi>Counſell of GOD,</hi> may well ſerve to be a compleat and principal Rule; But the Scriptures were given out and dictate by the <hi>Infallible GOD,</hi> and contain the whole <hi>Counſell of GOD.</hi> Therefore, They may well ſerve for to be a compleat and principal Rule.</p>
               <p>Anſwer firſt, Obſerve, That all his boaſting is come to no more then a <hi>May be,</hi> ſaying, <hi>It may ſerve to be a Primary Rule:</hi> And I muſt tell him, That a Cart-load of <hi>May-bees,</hi> are not worth <hi>One-is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> I muſt tell him, That his defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> is <hi>New,</hi> and I cannot accept of it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed to take notice of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I ſhall give my Reader an account of the Scope of this Mans Labours. <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:102472:31"/>
He cannot deny that the <hi>Quakers</hi> owne the Scriptures for a Rule, and his Work proves no leſs (tho in contradiction to himſelf in page 17.) And I can aſſure my Reader, That it is the conſtant care of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very true <hi>Quaker</hi> to <hi>ſquare his Life according to the Scriptures. Secondly,</hi> His offering to prove them to be a <hi>Primary Rule</hi> implyes (as I have ſaid) a <hi>Secondary:</hi> And this muſt be the <hi>Teachings of the Spirit,</hi> for he hath not told us of another: Hence the Reader may ſee, what the Tendancy of his Argumentations is, <hi>To wit,</hi> To exalt the Letter above the Spirit; The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture above the Creator, a Book above GOD; In which I cannot agree with him; Yet GOD knows I reverence the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as much as any <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in the World: And if the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſlighted them (as this falſe Accuſer ſlandereth them) I would have no fellowſhip with them. And certainly it is not ſo much the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as their own Gloſſes and Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations they plead for: For if <hi>Patroclus</hi> would ſpeak what he thinks, I doubt not but he would ſay, That the <hi>Weſtminſter Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Directory;</hi> Eſpecially having the <hi>Covenant</hi> joyned to it, might ſerve for a Rule of Faith and Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:102472:32"/>His Argument ſet down before erreth in the very form, according to the Rules of <hi>Logick;</hi> Which are when both Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are particular, nothing follows. And again particular, nothing follows. And again the <hi>Major</hi> being particular in the firſt figure cannot rightly conclude. Now that this <hi>Major</hi> is particular will be evident, if he explain himſelf what he means by the word (<hi>That</hi>) By which he cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Man nor beaſt, nor Angel nor any other thing, if he ſpeake ſenſe but <hi>that Book:</hi> And ſo his Argument will run thus, <hi>That particular Book which was dictate,</hi> &amp;c: But the Book called the BIBLE or the Scripture was dictate, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> If he thinks I have wronged him, let him explain himſelf next, and make his <hi>Major</hi> univerſal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is a direct begging of the Queſtion, for it is denyed that a Book can be the <hi>Primary Rule of Faith,</hi> for there was <hi>Faith</hi> before there was a <hi>Book</hi> in the World, and the World was two thouſand years without Scriptures, and if they had no Rule nor Law to walk by, then they had no ſin; <hi>For where there is no Law there is no tranſgreſſion:</hi> If they had a Rule, it was certainly <hi>Prior</hi> to the Scriptures, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the <hi>Primary</hi> Rule, except that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102472:32"/>
                  <hi>Patroclus</hi> would ſay, <hi>That GOD had changed his Rule!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Minor</hi> is a very uncontravetted Truth in the firſt part of it; But he muſt excuſe me to diſtinguiſh the ſecond; <hi>And contains the whole Counſel of GOD:</hi> Which I think <hi>Robert Barkelay</hi> hath done to very good Purpoſe; That the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a full account of all the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> and <hi>fundamental</hi> Doctrines of the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> But that many things occurr dayly of which the Scriptures do not clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine our Experience clearly proveth: And firſt as to <hi>Faith,</hi> I deſire he may give me plain Scripture for <hi>Perſons</hi> in the <hi>God. head? Sacraments</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Holy Sunday.</hi> This was required by K: <hi>CHARLES</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> from <hi>Alexander Henderſon;</hi> But how it was <hi>Anſwered,</hi> the Papers which paſt betwixt them will evince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to <hi>Life,</hi> I ask whether it was lawfull for me in my Youth to take the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant?</hi> Being firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Command of Chriſt, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> And then contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Supreem Magiſtrate; Yea, in oppoſition to Him, whome the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commands me to obey. This was a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102472:33"/>
Caſe of Conſcience to me, and yet by the <hi>Presbyterian Church</hi> I was commanded (<hi>his non obſtantibus</hi>) to take it; And by <hi>George Gilleſpie</hi> in his <hi>Caſses of Conſcience,</hi> the refuſing of the <hi>Covenant</hi> is called ſinful in it ſelf, a great diſhonour to GOD, and <hi>a great ſcandal to the Church, no leſs puniſhable then the killing of the Apoſtles.</hi> Nevertheleſs, <hi>I muſt ſay, I can find no Scripture which allows me to take it.</hi> And again there is a great doubt at preſent ſeeming to ariſe in the minds of many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and Well-wiſhers to the Government; Which is, whether the <hi>Popiſh Monarchical tyrranie</hi> in <hi>Church Government,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian Democratical tyrranie</hi> be more <hi>eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible?</hi> for it is now become a <hi>common Litanie;</hi> from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Presbytrie, libera nos,</hi> &amp;c. As for that great and incureable Schiſm, which deſtroyed <hi>Presbytrie</hi> in the Aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Dundee;</hi> Whether a <hi>Malignant</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Nation an Eſtate, Wife, and Children, might lawfully fight in defence of his Native Country; In Caſe of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Invaſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like doubts (ſaith he) page 56 <hi>Are to be reſolved by the Scriptures, applyed in Chriſtian prudence, and Spiritual Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> This is ſtrange, That there was neither <hi>Chriſtian prudence</hi> nor <hi>Spiritual Wiſdome</hi> in all the whole <hi>General Aſsembly!</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:102472:33"/>
That they ſplit upon ſuch a trivial Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and never reconciled again to this day: But the cauſe was, <hi>They lacked Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and did not <hi>ask of GOD who giveth liberally, and upbraideth not:</hi> For had they been <hi>taught of GOD</hi> and received the <hi>Word of Wiſdome</hi> from his <hi>Mouth,</hi> they would have ſeen this contraverſie to be as imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent as that about <hi>Eaſter</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next in page 39, he ſaith, <hi>The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men are to be charged with all theſe defects:</hi> This is very true, for the corruptions of men, and chiefly of the Clergie have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated them from knowing, or ſeeking to know the <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>Counſel</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> by the teachings of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and to lean to their own corrupt Wiſdom, their natural and acquired parts, hence ſome of them have not ſtuck to affirm, <hi>that a wicked Reprobate,</hi> a man <hi>void of grace, and of the ſpirit of Chriſt, may be a ſufficient Miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I leave his firſt argument, with his <hi>ſpurious definition</hi> of a Rule, I will give him another, which I think he will like the better, becauſe it comes from his brother the Author of <hi>Melius Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendum;</hi> Who ſayes, <hi>The mind and will of GOD, however notified to us, is the Rule of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102472:34"/>
our obedience.</hi> Now if <hi>Patroclus</hi> will prove that the mind and will of GOD was never notified or made known to mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> I ſhall grant to him, that the Scriptures are the <hi>primary</hi> or principal Rule, for the words ſignifie no more but firſt, or belonging to firſt, for the two words <hi>Primary</hi> or <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> being <hi>Latine</hi> words ſignifie no more but firſt or belonging to firſt, if we believe our <hi>Lexicons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prove that the Scriptures contain the whole Counſel of GOD, he citeth <hi>Acts.</hi> 20, 27. Whert <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus, That he had not ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to declare unto them all the Counſel of GOD.</hi> Here obſerve that this was before he had written his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and therefore I intreat <hi>Patroclus</hi> to inform us where we may find <hi>Pauls</hi> Preachings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded that he mentioneth here, wherein we may find all the <hi>Counſel of GOD;</hi> For it ſeems the Fathers at the Counſel of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea</hi> have forgotten to add them to the <hi>Cannon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His ſecond Argument is thus;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which was the Principal rule to the <hi>Jews</hi> is the Principal Rule to us: But the Scriptures were the Principal Rule to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102472:34"/>
them, therefore they muſt be the ſame to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> To begin with his <hi>Major,</hi> he ſaith it is <hi>Robert Barkclay</hi>'s; This is the hight of deceit, diſſingenuity, and Impudence: For in the ſecond Chapter of his apologie cited by our Author, there is no ſuch word to be found. In this Chapter he chiefly treateth of the formal object of faith, and but little of the Rule, he prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that indeed that <hi>Divine immediat Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> was the formal object of the Faith of the Ancients, and citeth <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> for examples, whom I believe to have had Faith, and alſo a Rule for their Faith before there was either Scripture or a <hi>Jew</hi> in the World; So that granting the <hi>Major</hi> he gains nothing by it, unleſs he can prove that the Scripture was the <hi>Primary Rule of Noah and Abrahams Faith,</hi> or elſe, that GOD hath changed his Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Minor I deny for the ſame reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I acknowledge that <hi>Moſes</hi> Law which is a part of the Scripture was more a Rule to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and more binding u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them then upon any of the Nations, or any living either then or ſince, And this is all that his after reaſonings can prove.</p>
               <p>But what if I ſhould ſay with other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:102472:35"/>
Writers, that the was givenpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for that Nation, and was bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon no other Nation in the World, as <hi>J: Humphry</hi> in his book called <hi>Medioeria,</hi> to which <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> a Famous <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> aſſents and ſubſcrives, I am of the ſame mind. <hi>R: Baxter</hi> of the <hi>Covenants,</hi> page 14. <q>The <hi>Old Covenant</hi> is that which GOD made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> led them in the Wilderneſs, the new is that which we have under the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> then is not the Covenant of works, for that was made with all in <hi>Adam,</hi> and as written in our hearts muſt be Eternally obligatory; but the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> was made with the <hi>Jews</hi> in oppoſition to other Nations, and as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to them is vaniſhed &amp; binds not: And for the ſame reaſon he ſayeth it is not the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> which is called the <hi>New Covenant:</hi> But ſaith he, the new is not the old.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The argument he bringeth to prove his <hi>Minor</hi> is that from which the <hi>Jews</hi> might not ſwerve to the right nor left hand, and to the deciſion of which they were ultimatly bound to ſtand in all doubts and contraverſies, and that upon higheſt pains, was the principal Rule; But from <hi>GOD's Writtin Law,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:102472:35"/>Therefore to them it was the <hi>Primary Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Firſt, This argument proveth no more then this is already granted, <hi>Viz.</hi> That <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was a more Principal Law to the <hi>Jews</hi> then to any other Nation. But untill he prove the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to have had no Law, no Rule of Faith nor Life before <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote that Law, his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can conclude nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Mine Adverſary may tell me, whether they were to ſtand to the deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law in a matter which the Law did not decide? for we find that after the Law was given; In many things the Law giver, <hi>Moſes,</hi> could not decide without <hi>immediate Revelation,</hi> as in the matter of the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad:</hi> But when the caſe was propoſed to him, he went and enquired of the Lord; And again, when the Law was finiſhed, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> to ſucceed him. What ſaith the LORD: <hi>Numb: 29. 21. And he (to wit) Joſhua) ſhall ſtand before Eleazer the Prieſt, who ſhall ask Counſel for him after the judgement of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim before the LORD.</hi> If this be ultimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to recurr to the Scriptures of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, the Reader may judge.</p>
               <p>To prove his <hi>Minor</hi> he citeth one place
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102472:36"/>
which I cannot omit, <hi>Dut: 17, 9, 10, 11 And thou ſhall come unto the Prieſts, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits, and unto the Judge that ſhall be in thoſe dayes, and enquire, and they ſhall ſhew thee the Sentence of Judgement, and thou ſhall do according to the ſentence which they of that place</hi> (which the LORD ſhall chooſe) <hi>ſhall ſhew thee, and thou ſhall obſerve to do according to all that they inform thee.</hi> Now Reader, could the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have ſought out a Scripture more fitt to have eſtabliſhed his univerſal Dictatorſhip over <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> then this? Is there one word of <hi>Scripture, Law</hi> or <hi>Teſtimony</hi> here? No, but the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the <hi>Levites,</hi> and the <hi>Judge:</hi> That is in <hi>Broad Scots,</hi> The General Aſſembly, and Committee of Eſtates, who were as abſolute in their Determinations, as ever the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Conclave: But <hi>Patroclus</hi> muſt know that he and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are not <hi>Levites,</hi> altho they <hi>take the Tithes,</hi> nor am I to take their Counſel, till they aſſure me that they have the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>

Truth; <hi>There is the Law and the Teſtimony in the Spirit as well as in the Letter, The Law of GOD is in the Heart, There it is written and there it teſtifies the Truth of GOD; And if any Man ſpeake not according to this Rule, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no Light nor Morning ariſen in them. the Spiritual Man judgeth all things, yet be himſelf is judged of no man.</hi>

               <p>Next he citeth ſome Scriptures to prove that <hi>Moſes</hi> Law is underſtood by the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony;</hi> As if GOD had made voide his Promiſe, <hi>To write his Law in the Heart,</hi> and <hi>put it in the inward parts:</hi> But of this a little after</p>
               <p>In page 35. He begins with a Queſtion drawn from <hi>Deut:</hi> 17. 18, 19. Now (ſayes he) <hi>Shall any be ſo ſtupid as to believe when a doubt aroſe, That the King was not bound to apply himſelf to this written Law for the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof? Or tho the King</hi>'s <hi>doubt had been moſt clearly diſcuſſed by the Law; He was bound to wait for a miraculous Revelation from Heaven to determine him?</hi> I ſay who in his Witts will believe this? Very well <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troclus,</hi> I am one ſo ſtupid as to believe that when a doubt aroſe, which <hi>Moſes</hi> Law could not clearly determine, that the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102472:37"/>
King was bound to enquire of the LORD; Of which the Scriptures gives us many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. As 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 23. 2. 4. and 30. 8. 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 2. 1. and 5. 19. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 7. And 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. Where the King, the High Prieſt, the Scribe, and ſome others, had the Book of the Law and knew not what to do with it, but ſent to enquire of the Lord, and that by the mouth of a Woman. But he hath been ſo warrie in his ſecond Querie as to add; <hi>Tho the Kings doubt had been moſt clearly diſcuſſed by the Law;</hi> Yet hath not the Candour to tell us, what the King was to do, in caſe his doubt was not clearly diſcuſſed by the Law. As for the word <hi>Miraculous Revelation,</hi> &amp;c: It is his own, a fine bugbear to fright his ſilly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from asking Counſel of GOD; For I am apt to believe, that Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is now a miracle among <hi>Presbyterian Prieſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To trace him in all his Raillings and Boaſtings, reflections againſt <hi>Ro: Barkelay</hi> and <hi>Geo: Keith,</hi> were very needleſs; The Reader may ſee them of no weight. I ſhall therefore here take notice of ſome of the Scriptures cited by him in page 34. To prove that by the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie</hi> is underſtood the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:102472:38"/>
on <hi>Exod: 32. 15. And Moſes turned, and went down from the Mount, and the two Tahles of the Teſtimony were in his hand,</hi> &amp;c. 34. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>9. <hi>With the two Tables of Teſtimony in Moſes hand,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now I beſeech the Reader to conſider what this Man can make from hence, or from any of the reſt, to prove that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> meant the two <hi>Tables of the Law</hi> to be a <hi>Primarie Rule</hi> either to <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Was never the <hi>Moral Law</hi> a Law to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, until it was written in Tables of Stone? Then certainly <hi>Cain</hi> had not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in killing of <hi>Abell;</hi> If there had been no Law againſt Murther; Or what more can he make of this Scripture (if he make the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Teſtimonie</hi> to be the <hi>Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements?</hi>) But this, That whoever ſpeaketh or acteth contrary unto them; It is becauſe he is dark, not knowing the Mind of the LORD; nor hearkning to the Voice of the <hi>Divine Light</hi> in him, which would have taught him to ſpeak and act according to that <hi>Moral Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I would willingly learn of him, whether he would have the whole Law of <hi>Moſes, Moral, Judicial,</hi> and <hi>Levitical,</hi> or <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> to be the <hi>Primarie Rule</hi> to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> now a dayes: For the <hi>Moral</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102472:38"/>
by all parties to be binding upon all Mankind, and that it was Imprinted upon the Souls of all Men, even before it was written: But the <hi>Judicial Law</hi> as well as the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> hath been rejected by all Chriſtians, except the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who compoſed <hi>Cargils Covenant.</hi> What then would the man be at? <hi>I</hi> can conjecture nothing but this; The <hi>Presbiterians</hi> have three beloved Doctrines, <hi>Viz: Swearing, Fighting,</hi> and <hi>Tithes,</hi> which no one Line of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſeems to favour, and therefore they would have the Law rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, leaſt theſe their Darlings fall.</p>
               <p>To conclude: <hi>The Law was added,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) becauſe of <hi>Tranſgreſſion.</hi> Therefore there was a Law or Rule tranſgreſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Law was added: And that it was a Written Law, let <hi>Patroclus</hi> prove with the next.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now come to his third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, page <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9. <q>Chriſt and his Apoſtles proved their Doctrines from the <hi>Scriptures</hi> referred their hearers unto them, for the final deciſion of the moſt grave and weighty Contraverſies that ever aroſe in the World; And ſent all people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them as a moſt ſure and undeceiving Light, by the Guiding of which we may

paſs through this dark World, and be kept from Hell in the cloſe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Scriptures are the <hi>Primary Rule,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To prove the Conſequence of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, he ſendeth us to the Definition of (<hi>a may be</hi>) Rule in his firſt Argument; which is proven to be lame, and a begging of the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Next to prove his <hi>Antecedent,</hi> he citeth a Bundle of Scriptures, for merly adduced by his Brethren, and anſwered divers times: But he thinks all the reſt but Bunglers, and therefore he will have at them again.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, <hi>Mat. 22. 29, 31, 32. Te do err not knowng the Scriptures, nor the Power of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He begins with a parcel of <hi>Presbyterian Rbetorick,</hi> ſaying, Our Adverſaries <hi>are like Baits,</hi> &amp;c. Let the Reader judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have occaſion here for a Repartee, but Ple ſpare him.</p>
               <p>There be Two Things in the Citation, for the Ignorance of which the <hi>Jews</hi> are blamed, to wit, Of the Scriptures and the Power of God. Now if this prove one of them to be a Rule, it cannot miſs to prove the other to be a Rule alſo: And ſo the Contraverſy remains in <hi>ſtain quo prius,</hi> that is, Whether the Scriptures, or Chriſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102472:39"/>
the power of God, and the Wiſdom of God, Teaching and Revealing the Mind and Will of God to his People, is to be preferred. The <hi>Quakers</hi> never denied the Scriptures to be a Rule, but only that they were ſubordinat to the Teachings of Chriſt by His Spirit, Whom He promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſend, and that he ſhould Teach them all Things: And this I ſay is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrable, and he hath brought nothing to prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>This cleareth <hi>George Keith</hi> from what he alledgeth, of his confounding the <hi>Rule with the Power:</hi> And as for his <hi>Simile</hi> of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid,</hi> it will nothing mend his Matter; for certainly <hi>Euclid</hi> had a Rule by which he wrote his Book, which was the Dictats of his <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and except his Propoſitions can be demonſtrated to me by Reaſon, I am not bound to believe them. Therefore the Dictats of my Reaſon are a more No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Excellent Rule to me than <hi>Euclid's</hi> Propoſitions, tho the Book be an excellent Help for me to attain to that Art.</p>
               <p>And whereas he hath talked very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully, though wrongfully, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounding the Scriptures and the Power of God, he ſhould have remembred that in Page 36. He hath ſaid, <hi>That to ſeek to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102472:40"/>
Scriptures is all one with ſeeking unto GOD:</hi> Whether this vergeth upon Blaſphemy, let the Reader Judge.</p>
               <p>But to put our Stupidity or prejudice beyond doubt, he brings us another ſimile of a King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Above all things he ſhould have ſhunned dilcourſing upon this <hi>Topick;</hi> For it is impoſſible to keep a <hi>Presbyterion Prieſt</hi> within his Bounds: Here he hath deſcribed a King in <hi>Querpo,</hi> ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the Laws and limited by them.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is well known, That the King is the fountain of our Law, our <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator:</hi> And by the ſame Authority whereby he <hi>makes</hi> Laws, can <hi>caſhier annul</hi> and reſcind them: And it is a known <hi>Maxim</hi> in Law, <hi>Rex non poteſt peccare;</hi> But this is the old Doctrine of <hi>Lex Rex,</hi> and <hi>Jus Populi:</hi> And that famous peece, <hi>The Hynd let looſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if this his Simile prove any thing, it will be this, That as (according to their Dialect) <hi>The King can do nothing but what the Law of the Land allows:</hi> So GOD can do nothing but what the Scripture allows: And conſequently CHRIST could not command the Man to take up his Bed and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102472:40"/>
walk upon the Sabbath day, becauſe no Scripture then written allowed it.</p>
               <p>The next place is, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. Here he challengeth R. B. as a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Words ought to have been Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>Ye ſearch the Seriptures:</hi> But <hi>Patroclus,</hi> If I ſhall cite <hi>Bellarinine</hi> againſt the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tiths (who ſay they, <hi>Are not due by any Law of GOD or Nature, ſince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt</hi>) Will thou alſo call me a <hi>Papiſt?</hi> If thou do, thou att miſtaken; And ſo art thou in him. And when thou can prove that there are no errors in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, thou may ſtick by this. The Scriptures thou brings prove nothing for this Tranſlation, for they do not mention it; And we never denyed it, that the reading of the Scripture was both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and commended; Yet thou art not aſhamed to ſay, <hi>They are ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince theſe Men of palpable falſhood and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</hi> This is Language for the Pulpit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Hood-winked hearers, but will trouble no unprejudiced Reader.</p>
               <p>As to the great ſtreſs he layeth upon theſe words, <hi>And theſe are they that teſtifie of me;</hi> Therefore they are the <hi>Primary Rule.</hi> Did he not ſay, <hi>The Works which I do, They hear witneſs of Me?</hi> And if we may believe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102472:41"/>
Hiſtory, the <hi>Sybills</hi> teſtified of him: Doth this prove that they were the <hi>Primary Rule?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the very foregoing Verſe is to be conſidered, <hi>And ve have not his Word abiding in you, for whom be hath ſent, him ve believe not.</hi> And verſe 36. <hi>I have a greater Witneſs then that of John; For the works which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given me to finiſh, the ſame works that I do bear witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</hi> Here let him conſider, that in the mouth of two or three Witneſſes, every thing is to be proven. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour bringeth here four Witneſſes, The <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> The <hi>Works which he did,</hi> The <hi>Word of GOD abiding in Men,</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> The contraverſy is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of theſe or all of them were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but which of them was the greateſt and moſt Preferrable? And if the Works which He then did were a greater Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then the <hi>Teſtimony of John</hi> (who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to none of the Prophets) Then the Works which He now doth in the Hearts and Souls of Believers by His Word abiding in them, in healling all their Infirmities, quickning and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their dead Souls, and ſpeaking peace
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102472:41"/>
to them; <hi>is a greater Witneſs</hi> then the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He falls next upon R. Bs. <hi>Dilemma,</hi> Which he ſaith, <hi>hath not the weight of a Walnut;</hi> It ſeems the hardneſs of the ſhell hath blunted his teeth, that he hath not reached the Kernal. For (ſaith he) <hi>If the words are to be taken in the Imperative mood, as we have even now demonſtrated, then it is as clear as the Noon Sun,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But how hath he demonſtrated it? That the Word bears not the Indicative Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; as well as the Imperative, is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to any that underſtands the Conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And the Scriptures brought to prove it. I ſhall touch ſome of them <hi>Deut:</hi> 17. 18, 19. <hi>And be ſhall read therein all the days of his Life: Ergo,</hi> The Words <hi>John</hi> 5: 39. Are to be taken in the <hi>Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Mood,</hi> If this be not as wild a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as to ſay <hi>William Jamiſon</hi> is <hi>verus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troelus</hi> by a <hi>Metempychoſis, Ergo,</hi> The whole Church of <hi>England</hi> are <hi>Hereticks,</hi> (which he hath boldly aſſerted in his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultory</hi> Epiſtle to his Patron) I leave it to the Reader to Judge.</p>
               <p>The next he brings is, <hi>Deut:</hi> 29. 29. <hi>The Secret things belong to the LORD our GOD, but thoſe Things which are revealed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102472:42"/>
belong to us and to our Children for ever, that we may do all the Words of this Law. Ergo,</hi> The Words of <hi>John</hi> are to be taken in the <hi>Imperative mood;</hi> Who would follow ſuch an Adverſary at this Rate?</p>
               <p>But ſeeing he is ſo good at Wall-nuts, I will give him another of the ſame kind to break,</p>
               <p>Either the Words of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> (who was as great a Prophet as <hi>Iſaiah</hi>) were as much a Rule to the Jews when ſpoken by him, as they are now to us when recorded in a Book, or as the words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> formerly recorded in a Book; or they were not? If they were, Then the Works which Chriſt worketh now in the Souls of His Servants, muſt be a greater Witneſs then the words of <hi>John</hi> recorded in a Book; As well as the Works he then did were a greater Witneſs.</p>
               <p>But if he ſay, they were <hi>not ſo much a Rule when ſpoken, as when written</hi> I ask him, how they came by that excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by being Written? Or was it the Council of <hi>I aodicea</hi> that gave it?</p>
               <p>Page 43 He ſaith, <hi>He hath broken one of the Horns of his Dilemma, and made his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence a meer Nonſequitor.</hi> 
                  <q>And why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath confeſſed (ſaith he) in a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102472:42"/>
word, That the Words of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as then ſpoken &amp; now record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture, were of themſelves no leſs binding upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> then theſe ſpoken by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But this hath ſtrengthned the <hi>Dilemma,</hi> for if they were as binding, and yet need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Rule to try them by; Then the Writtings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Rule to try them by, and that Rule another Rule; <hi>Et ſic infinitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That all Doctrines of Men may be tryed, and ought ſo to be by the Scriptures, was never denyed; And hath no way given away his Cauſe. But as for what follows, That it might be lawful to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any impulſe or ſuggeſtion, which he thought was the Spirit of GOD; With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further Examination thereof, is a groſs untruth, but ordinary to him and his Brethren; And therefore he hath wiſely foreborn to tell us where <hi>R: Barkelay</hi> ſaid ſo.</p>
               <p>His third Scriptute is, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. He ſaith, <hi>His Adverſaries can find nothing to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and deprive it, and therefore he waves it.</hi> Not being willing to meddle with what R: B: ſaith there: <hi>To wit,</hi> If the <hi>Bereans</hi> were oblidged to believe and receive <hi>Pauls
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102472:43"/>
Teſtimony,</hi> becauſe he preached the Truth to them by Authority from GOD; Then their uſing them, or his commending of them for uſing the ſcriptures; Will not prove the ſcriptures to be the <hi>Primary Rule,</hi> Yea more a Rule than the Doctrine they tryed by it. For it the Doctrine preached by <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Bereans,</hi> had been but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in a Book, it had preſently become a <hi>Primary Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth is, 2 <hi>Peter 1. 19. We have a more ſure word of propheſie,</hi> &amp;c. This place he will have to be meant of the ſcriptures. His firſt proofi is, Becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>This preſuppoſeth, that there cannot be immediat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation where the ſenſes go along: And ſo their ſpirit is contrary to ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is an old Cavil againſt <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and brought on the ſtage by <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtat,</hi> in his Book againſt the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians.</hi> This Doctrine (ſaid he) <hi>ſigbteth againſt common ſenſe:</hi> See <hi>Chron: Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> page 278.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102472:43"/>
And why ſhould it become the <hi>Primary Rule</hi> when recorded in a Book, and not the Rule when ſpoken immediatly on the Mount; If thou ſay, Becauſe it is more obvious to ſenſe, then it ſeems thy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is more ſenſual than Spiritual.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Argument is, <hi>That this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> (according to us) <hi>brings along with it its own ſelf Evidence, and perſwades the Soul to embrace and cloſe with it as Divine:</hi> But this is both groundleſs, and therefore falſe (ſaith he) becauſe we aſſert, <hi>that unleſs the Underſtanding be well diſpoſed, Revelation tho immediate, is not evident.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer firſt, He here brings nothing to prove this, That it is groundleſs and falſe; except his <hi>ipſe dixit;</hi> And therefore I may not take his word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What had all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before <hi>Moſes Law,</hi> and even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf to try their Revelations by? Yet they believed them upon their own ſelf evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Yea, <hi>Balaam</hi> who had no well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Intellect, yet knew and believed his Revelations to be Divine. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Doctor <hi>Barron</hi> in his Book againſt <hi>Turnbul,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the moſt noble kind of Revelation is, that which is by intellectual ſpeaking or illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as</hi> Thomas <hi>and Swarez teach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He ſaith, We inſinuate, <hi>That
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102472:44"/>
the Apoſtle in this Compariſon, gave out that one of the things compared was more certain than the other; Which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is moſt falſe;</hi> Seing conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, both have all certainly poſſible. But in reſpect of us (ſaith he) <hi>The Scriptures are more ſure, becauſe leſs ſubject to be counterfeited or wreſted either by the Devil or our own fancie;</hi> But here (it ſeems) he hath forgotten himſelf, for this ſame Apoſtle hath told us that the Scripture can be wreſted. But who, ſaith that the teachings of the Spirit of truth can be ſo? None but <hi>Patroclus;</hi> And ſo the compariſon holds, that which can be wreſted is leſs ſure then that which cannot be wreſted. He adds, the Apoſtle hath his eye upon his Country men; And ſo have I upon mine, who pretend ſo much to the Scriptures, and yet wreſt them groſly to their own damnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page,</hi> 46. comes to prove, that by theſe words (<hi>more ſure word of Propheſie</hi>) are meant the Scriptures; after he hath told us that albeit <hi>immediat Revelation</hi> were meant or underſtood by the more ſure word of Propheſie, it would be no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us, becauſe it is recommended to us: As that whereby we may come to the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102472:44"/>
genuine interpretation of the Scriptures, and ſo not the <hi>Principal rule,</hi> but a means to explain the <hi>Principal Rule,</hi> and for this he brings no proof, but we muſt take his word, and then he will make us <hi>Quid libet ex quo libet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſaith, by theſe words <hi>a more ſure word of Propheſie,</hi> is underſtood the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe any phraſe of the like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is alwayes taken for the Scriptures, as <hi>Luke</hi> 16, 29. <hi>Eph:</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. 12. And yet he confeſſeth in a Parentheſis, the words <hi>Logos Propheticos,</hi> are not to be ſound in all the Scripture beſides, but by the words <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> are meant the Scriptures; <hi>Ergo,</hi> by the more ſure word of Propheſie are meant the Scriptures: This is a <hi>non ſeqitur,</hi> with a witneſs.</p>
               <p>The reſt of his arguments ſuch as, if our Adverſarys were not affronted, and impudently bold, ſuch as would adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon any thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the like; Are not worthy of any anſwer: But ſeeing he would explain one Scripture by another, I will help him to one more ſit, <hi>John</hi> 1. 4, 5. Where it is ſaid, <hi>In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men, and the Light ſhineth in the darkneſs, and the darkneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended it not.</hi> How like this is to the more
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102472:45"/>
ſure <hi>word of Propheſie,</hi> which ſhineth as a Light in a dark place; But the life of CHRIST, the light in men, is a <hi>ſeare Crow</hi> to <hi>Presbyterian Prieſts,</hi> they cannot abide it One reaſonleſs reaſon he gives us, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men are commended for ſearching the Scriptures; But I would be obliged to him if he would form a Syllogiſm upon the <hi>medium,</hi> and draw his concluſion from it.</p>
               <p>In <hi>page</hi> 48 he tells us, that <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. Underſtand it ſo. Is this fare dealing <hi>Patroclus?</hi> Doſt thou agree with <hi>Luther,</hi> or even with <hi>Calvin</hi> in all things? If thou ſay yea, I'le prove that contrary, and yet their Teſtimony muſt oblige us; Then he computes us among Ancient <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but he would not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied if I ſhould compute him and his brethren among <hi>Mahumitans</hi> for beliving a Stoical Fate. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He leaveth us to graple with <hi>William Penn's Rejoynder, page,</hi> 334, who, he ſayeth, yieldeth to him what we deny.</p>
               <p>To ſatisfie the Reader, I ſhall ſet down ſome of <hi>William Penns</hi> words; He ſayeth, <hi>John Faldo</hi> acknowledgeth, <hi>That the writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are not more true in themſelves than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Revelation of the mind of GOD, but more

certain with reſpect to the</hi> Jews, <hi>who bad a greater eſteem for, and teſtimony of the writings of the Prophets to be of GOD, and not a deluſion, then of</hi> Peters <hi>Revelation;</hi> So that we here have (ſaith <hi>William Penn</hi>) from <hi>John Faldo</hi> himſelf; <hi>The ſcripture is not ſet above the Spirit as the more ſure word, the thing promoted of old by our enemies, and which we only oppoſe:</hi> For I doubt not but the Scriptures were more lure to the <hi>Jews</hi> then CHRIST Himſelf, elſe they would never have thought to find Eternal life in them, whilſt they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, yea perſecuted him; Which, whether it was their perfection or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſo to do, I leave with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my ſerious Reader, which I likewayes do whether <hi>Patroclus</hi> be a fair adverſary or any honeſt man.</p>
               <p>He comes next to <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 31. <hi>If they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let the Reader obſerve that this is a Parable, and that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that any ſuch apparitions are but Devils aſſuming the body, or the ſhape of the dead: And therefore any thing may be more certain to them then ſuch a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and we read of none ſuch but that of <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Secondly,</hi> This Scripture brings no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betwixt the Scripture and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and whereas he ſaith, let the <hi>Quakers prove that every man hath ſuch a ſpirit as the Quakers alledge, this ſhall come in its own place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next he proveth the Scriptures to be the <hi>Primary Rule,</hi> becauſe otherwiſe <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> might have ſaid, the Spirit of GOD directeth every man immediatly; If they hear not him they will hear none elſe: If <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid ſo (it ſeems <hi>Patroclus</hi> would have been diſpleaſed; But a greater then <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid ſo, even the LORD JESUS John, 14. 26. <hi>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things,</hi> whoſe teaching are preferable to all the writings in the world, ſeeing he taught them what they wrote, and their being dictated by him, giveth them all their excellency.</p>
               <p>He ſaith <hi>R: Barkclay</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Scriptures were a written Rule to the Jews only, is nothing to the purpoſe,</hi> but he ſhould not have belyed him, for he ſaith, <hi>they were a more principal Rule to the Jews; But never that they were a principal Rule to the Jews.</hi> He paſſeth by what he ſaid upon the Scripture, <hi>Viz. Page,</hi> 40. This Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable was uſed by Chriſt to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to ſhew them their <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi> who albeit they
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102472:46"/>
deceitfully pretended to reverence and ſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> low <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; Yet they did not really hear them, elſe they would have acknowledged him, of what <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the Prophets did ſo clearly write, ſince he did as great and convincing Mitacles before them, as if they had the Teſtimony of one Riſen from the Dead.</p>
               <p>In like manner the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> now, albeit they pretend ſo much to reverence the writings of the Apoſtles, yet they will not really hear them, elſe they would not <hi>fight, ſwear,</hi> nor exact a <hi>forced mantainance,</hi> even from theſe who are not of the communion of their Church.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Third</hi> argument is, <hi>Certainly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the voice of one of the Glorified Spirits coming from Heaven, where they behold the Face of GOD, is no leſs to be accounted immediate Revelation, then the voice of the high Prieſt unto the people,</hi> &amp;c. But he ſhould have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that GOD took his method to reveal his mind unto his people, which he never did: But the High Prieſt was a <hi>Tipe of Chriſt,</hi> and a <hi>Mediator betwixt GOD and the Jews:</hi> So that to deny this to be immediate, becauſe it was firſt ſpoken to the High Prieſt, is to deny the words of Chriſt to be immediate to his people, becauſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102472:47"/>
he ſaith, he had <hi>heard and received them of the Father;</hi> or that the light of the Sun is not immediate, becauſe it is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us through the Air. Only let him tell me, whether the ſupream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate who is at preſent troubled with the clamours of the two kinds of Clergy-men in <hi>Scotland,</hi> can go and inquire of the LORD, and have as certain an anſwer, which of the two Church Government are <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> many times had, and then he ſayes ſomething? For the <hi>Jews</hi> had the Scriptures, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets as well as we, and yet were many times neceſſitat to go and enquire of the LORD, which evidently proves they had a higher rule then <hi>Moſes</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>In <hi>page</hi> 50, he giveth an argument like the reſt, <hi>Viz. Gods way of Revealing himſelf to us, is as immediat as it was to the Jews, becauſe we have thoſe that were inſpired by GOD, ſpeaking to us tho Dead.</hi> Hence he concludes, that the Scriptures are as immediat to us as the voice of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the High Prieſt, or the Prophets was to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Argument is ſingular for deceit &amp; ſolly; for <hi>Firſt,</hi> where did any <hi>Quaker</hi> deny the Scriptutes to be the <hi>Primary Rule</hi> upon the account of their not being immediatly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102472:47"/>
revealed we acknowledege that they were immediatly revealed to the Prophets and Apoſtles, &amp; recorded by them, but this doth not let them above the Spirit which did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal them, and ſo his groſs lie and his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are both anſwered; and yet he might have conſidered that the promiſe of Chriſt is more full to his people then it was to the <hi>Jews;</hi> As he may read, <hi>Matt: 10: 19, 20. It ſhall be given you the ſame hour what ye ſhall ſpeak, for it is not ye that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father that ſpeaketh in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His fourth argument from 2 <hi>Then. 3. 15. Is, That which is able to make ſuch an one as Timothy, called the man of GOD, wiſe through faith unto Salvation, muſt be a ſufficient Rule,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the Scriptures are able to do ſo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore they are a ſufficient Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This argument militates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt us, for the Queſtion is not, whether the Scriptures be a Rule, but whether they be the <hi>Primary Rule,</hi> which this Argument toucheth not, and Faith is added here as a <hi>principal ingredient,</hi> which themſelves acknowledge to be a work of the Spirit, this Faith hath a rule; as alſo that faith whereby a man believes the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of the Scriptures, let him tell me with the next, what is the <hi>Rule of this Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:102472:48"/>He tells next, The ſcriptures are <hi>Cauſa exemplaris,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Primary Rule,</hi> they call them <hi>cauſa formalis, Cauſa mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialis, cauſa exemplaris;</hi> And the word <hi>make</hi> would ſeem to make them <hi>cauſa efficiens,</hi> ſo that according to them, they are, <hi>To Pan,</hi> and the Spirit <hi>Vers Nihil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the Scriptures being <hi>Cauſa exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> he ſaith, I evidently inferr that they are the <hi>adequat &amp; Primary Rule,</hi> becauſe if there were ſome things to be believed and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed not contained in Scripture: Or if they were ſubject to another Teſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They could not in truth be called <hi>able to make the man of GOD wiſe unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> This I have anſwered before, if he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Eſſentials and fundamentals of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> It is confeſſed, they do contain them, but there are many things occur in our <hi>Chriſtian courſe</hi> (as he words it) which the Scriptures do not determine. Such as whether it was <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Antichriſtian courſe for the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians to come up to Bothwel-Bridge to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the late aſſembly ought to have united with their Brethren of the <hi>Epiſcopal perſwaſion,</hi> till they had undergone <hi>Pennance</hi> for their <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> upon <hi>the Stool of Repentance.</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:102472:48"/>
The <hi>Firſt</hi> brought much trouble upon the Nation, and the <hi>Second</hi> is feared to be of no better conſequence, except our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor bring us clear Scripture to determine the caſe, to the ſatisfaction of all parties.</p>
               <p>He ſaith <hi>little Juſtice. Truth,</hi> or <hi>fare deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to be expected from us,</hi> But far leſs from him ſo long as he truſts more to <hi>Ariſtotles Elenobis</hi> in frameing deceitful Sophiſms, then to the Teſtimony of the Spirit of Chriſt; the reaſon he gives for this great calumny is, becauſe R. B. accuſeth his brother <hi>John Brown</hi> for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Scriptute. 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3. 16. Now it is evident that the 16, <hi>Ver:</hi> hath no ſuch word in it, and that the 17 <hi>Verſ</hi> ſaith only, <hi>That the man of GOD may be perfect;</hi> So the difference here is very obvious, which R. B. hath largely handled in the ſame 41 page, and our Author takes no notice of it, but moſt deceitfully inſinuates that he makes the ſcriptures <hi>Tautologies,</hi> becauſe he cannot evite the diſtinction there made by R. B. To which place (never touched by our Author) I refer my Reader.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, (ſaith he) <hi>For we love rather to plead by weight of Arguments then by multitude of Arguments. Anſwer,</hi> If this had been true, thou had ſpared a dale of Paper and pains.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:102472:49"/>
                  <hi>We evine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>That the Scriptures are a compleat adequate and Primary Rule of Faith and Manners, by the Teſtimony of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> If this be true, it is manifeſt that allhe hath ſaid on that Subject, is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous: Againſt whom did the Man write? Omercileſs Adverſarie This is like the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in Q: <hi>Marys</hi> time: Tho you recant and be received into the Church, yet you muſt burn! But let us hear what he faith?</p>
               <p>His Proofs are theſe, <hi>Firſt, R: Barkclay's Vindication,</hi> page 36. <hi>The chief Doctrines of Chriſtianity are contained in Scripture,</hi> And we may find the whole Doctrine of the Chriſtian Faith in tho Scriptures: And <hi>George Keith</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Scriptures are a full enough declaration of all Doctrines and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Both theſe I have cleared before granting all that they ſaid; And yet have proven that many things may and do occurr, which the Scriptures do not clearly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>The other Branch that they are the <hi>Primary Rule, Our Adverſaries themſelves</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>at unawates grant.</hi> Very well <hi>Patroelus,</hi> it is a fine trick of a Souldier to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102472:49"/>
take his Enemies napping and vanquiſh by ſtratagem, but it ſeems there is ſome difficulty in it.</p>
               <p>He citeth <hi>R: Barkclays 2d. Theſes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That the Spirit is not to be ſubjected to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as a more noble Rule;</hi> Therefore (ſaith he) <hi>The Spirit is to be ſubjected to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, tho not as a more noble Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer firſt,</hi> He ſhould have ſaid, Theſe Divine Revelations, for they are the words of the <hi>Theſe;</hi> But we have often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that all Doctrines of Men, how holy ſoever, or how much ſoever they pretend to the Spirit, are to be tryed by the Scriptures, and if they be contrary to them are to be rejected; But this proves nothing of their being the <hi>Primary Rule</hi> to us, more then to <hi>Enoch</hi> who was a Man of GOD, and had true Faith, and walked with GOD before there was a line of Scripture in the World.</p>
               <p>Again, (he ſaith) <hi>Our Adverſaries grant that the Scriptures proceeded from GOD, and therefore are infalible, and more ſure than infalible is impoſſible.</hi> This is a ſtrange Argument. The Scriptures are infallible becauſe they proceeded from GOD, or were inſpired by the Spirit of GOD; And ſhall the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Spirit be fallible, or a more uncertain Rule then that which it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102472:50"/>
dictated? Theſe words ſound harſhly But I expect when <hi>Patreclus</hi> comes to be ſerious in cold Blood, he will grant, That if there be more or leſs in the Caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, he will grant the more to the Spirit which dictated the Scriptures, and from which they derive all their Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Certainty, and Excellency.</p>
               <p>Here I deſire the Reader may obſerve, that his Arguments and the Scriptures cited by him, tend only to ſet up <hi>Moſes</hi> Law to be the <hi>Primary Rule</hi> of Faith and Life; And not one word of the Scriptures of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> ſo that he contends for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm</hi> rather then <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> For Chriſt ſaid, <hi>It hath been ſaid of Old, an Eye for an Eye,</hi> &amp;c: But I ſay unto you reſiſt not evil, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> So that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law is not in all things to be a Rule for Chriſtians; Otherwayes <hi>Patroclus</hi> may ofter Sacrifice as well as take Tithes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the Judge be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon diſtinct form the perſon judged, for (to uſe his own Simile) If the Man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> yet be his own Judge, he is not like to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What he meaneth by the Ex: Poſition he gives us of the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; As if he thinketh it nothing elſe but a Filial Diſpoſition, inclining the believer to come to GOD, as his Words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
               <p>Behold Reader, what a Judgement is here to be expected; Where the Man
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102472:51"/>
himſelf diſlected into ſo many Parts, is the Applyer of the Rule, the Judge and the Witneſſes. And yet in page 57 He confeſſeth, That for the infallible Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Perſon himſelf, the thing ſtandeth in need of, or requireth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Judge, and inward Witneſſes; Which I hope muſt be things diſtinct from the Perſon himſelf to whom they are to give infallible certainty.</p>
               <p>As for his pretending, <hi>That it belongeth not properly to a Rule of Faith to tell a Man whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath true Faith or not, is not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; For an adequate Rule of Faith muſt put me beyond doubting what I am to believe, and what not; Otherwayes it is no adéquate Rule.</hi> And to conclude, I would adviſe him to be ſparing in calling Men <hi>Anti-Chriſtian:</hi> For I know no people, except the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to whom the definition of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> given by the Apoſtles, is more agreeable then to the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> That is, <hi>He exalteth himſelf above all that is called God,</hi> or the civil Magiſtrates, who are called <hi>Gods</hi> in Scripture, <hi>Goodman</hi> ſaith, <hi>they may kill wicked Princes as monſters, and oruel beaſts.</hi>

               <p>If theſe <hi>Doctrines</hi> be not more like <hi>Anti-Chriſt,</hi> than the Doctrine he accuſerh, let the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 57 he cometh to another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>R. B's, There are many things that the Scripture cannot determine.</hi> To which I: B: Anſwers, <hi>That General Rules are enough, leaving the reſt to Chriſtian prudence, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome!</hi> If this be not flatly to contradict the Scriptures concerning the chief Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cited by R: B: Let the Reader judge after he hath read and conſidered the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Rom. 8: 16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with our ſpirits, that we are the Children of GOD.</hi>

               <p>To theſe <hi>Scriptures</hi> cited by R: B: He hath not anſwered one Word: Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> all his Anſwers are <hi>Quibles.</hi> As firſt, <hi>If we need Revelation for Spiritual Actions, we need them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for Natural Actions.</hi> Poor Man! Are we
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102472:52"/>
contending for a Rule for Eating and Drinking (as he talks) If he be ſick, let him conſult the Phyſician, what and when he ſhall Eat: But if he mean the Faſts appointed by the <hi>Presbyterian Clergie,</hi> his Brethren of the EPISCOPAL <hi>Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> have need to conſult an higher <hi>Oracle,</hi> And when he is hungry and thirſty, his ſtomach can teach him. Nevertholeſs, <hi>Whether we eat or drink, we are to do it to the Glorie of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>ſecond Anſwer</hi> is ridiculous, alledging that a ſyſtem of <hi>Mathematicks</hi> or <hi>Military Diſcipline</hi> is a ſufficient <hi>Rule,</hi> tho the Books comprehended not the Names of all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians and Souldiers that ever ſhall exiſt But the Queſtion is, Whether a ſyſtem of theſe Arts can put a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond doubting in every Emergent that may occurr in theſe Arts when practiſed? And not whether their Names be there or not. As whether he is to take upon him to be General of an Army, as R: B: tells his Adverſary, page 45 of his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication. The Queſtion is, how <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> Knew they ſhould take upon them to Rule? But in caſe theſe ſyſtems faile to ſatisfie a Man at a ſtrait (which I hope any experienced Souldier will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102472:52"/>
and the daily new Inventions do ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evince) What then is the Souldier to recurr to? Is it not to that by which the firſt Man wrote the Syſtem, That is, his Reaſon; And ſee if that can help him when his Book cannot: Yea, have there not been good Souldiers who could neither Read nor Write? Yes, General <hi>Leſly,</hi> who did more for the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Intereſt then <hi>Patroelus</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> both can do. And will a Mathematician receive a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Propoſition ſet down in a Syſtem hand over head, without ſatisfying his Reaſon? Theſe are poor ſimiles, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurtful then helpful to his Cauſe; If by theſe he minds to prove, <hi>That humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can aſſure a man that he is a Child of God.</hi> I am apt to ſuſpect by his Book that he hath never troden this narrow Path himſelf; Elſe he would have ſpoken other Language. Next he comes to anſwer for his Brethren the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> and <hi>Publick Reſolutioners,</hi> comparing then (indeed) to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas:</hi> But he hath forgot to tell us which of them was in the right, and to decide the Contraverſie by plain Scripture to the ſtopping the mouths of the other Party, but I doubt this would have puzled his prudence. As for his Inſtance of <hi>Paul</hi> and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102472:53"/>
                  <hi>Barnabas,</hi> their contention was not for matters of Faith or Doctrine as <hi>Beza</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and the Scripture ſaith no where that they did not meet again; But our Aſſembly Men never reconciled to this day.</p>
               <p>But knowing this will not do, he giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a better Anſwer, Saying, <hi>The Corruptions of Men are only to be charged with this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah! Lamentable, The whole <hi>General Aſsemblie</hi> of the <hi>Church of Scotland</hi> corrupt men: What guides then had ſuch poor <hi>Laicks</hi> as I? Put all this ſaith nothing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he decide the Contraverſy by plain Scripture; Which when he hath done, I ſhall ſay, It's pity he was not preſent at the <hi>Aſsembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next he falls upon ſome other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he tells us <hi>are ſcraped out of Bellarmine,</hi> and therefore deſerve no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Which Anſwer, whether true or falſe I know not, having never read <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi> Works: But I find this is a fair ſhift to win off, and an Hebergeon proof againſt any Dart.</p>
               <p>He ſpendeth his whole page 60. on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, Firſt on <hi>James Naylor;</hi> he might have remembered <hi>Major Weir.</hi> But <hi>De

mortuis nill,</hi> &amp;c: I diſdain to ſcrape in that <hi>Dung-hill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next he compares us to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, As the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to cover the reſt of their Abominations, have invented a greater and more dangerous than them all, that is, <hi>Their Churches Infallibility:</hi> So this Spirit of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> knowing that upon tryal he will be found to be a Counterfeit, hath taken the Counſel given by <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to <hi>Pericles,</hi> that is, To ſtudy how he may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelf with the hazard of a Tryal. And here he cites <hi>William Penn's Rejoinder, Part. 1. Chap.</hi> 5. about the Man of <hi>Philippi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I beſeech the Reader to peruſe the place cited by him, that he may ſee him paſt all ſhame, or care of being reputed an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man. For <hi>Firſt</hi> he ſays, <hi>W. Penn</hi> uſeth it as an Argument to prove, <hi>The Scriptures cannot be a Rule of Faith and Life;</hi> whereas in the ſame Page, <hi>W. Penn</hi> hath owned them for a Rule of Faith and Life, tho not the Rule by way of Excellency, nor, as <hi>Patroclus</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Primary Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He makes no Argument of it, but an Inſtance, as he doth that of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> That the Scriptures could not be a Rule to <hi>Peter</hi> nor <hi>Paul</hi> in theſe caſes; as he doth that alſo of flying or
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102472:54"/>
ſtanding in the time of Perſecution; and asketh what do Profeſſors mean, when they adviſe People to ſeek the Lord in this o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the other Caſe? Why do they not go ſeek the Scriptures rather? and much more, which for brevity lomit.</p>
               <p>To evite all which, he makes a Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſical Argument, and denies the <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> when he had none. And then falls a Railing for a whole Page together, a part whereof I have ſet down above.</p>
               <p>For Anſwer to which: <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> own no other Spirit but the <hi>Comforter,</hi> whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed to ſend to Reprove the World for Sin (for they never refuſed to ſubject the Spirits and Doctrines of Men to the Scriptures) and therefore if he have called the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> a Counterfier, the juſt God will Rebuke him for his Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And this poor Man, who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to no more Infallibility than the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, (who had the Scriptures as well as he, and yet were found guilty of Blaſphemy againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>) may be affraid he be found in the ſame Caſe with them. But I wiſh he may find Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> may be no leſs fitly compared with the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> For
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102472:54"/>
their Doctrines being tryed by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they being Interpreters themſelves, it is a meer ſham to ſpeak of a Tryal: For whatever Interpretation doth not agree with the Analogie of Faith, is to be rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Now the Analogie of Faith is of their own compoſing, ſo that Faith and Tryal and all is but Mans work, and <hi>in fine a</hi> very cheat.</p>
               <p>But next he muſt give us the moſt dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blow of all; Saying, <hi>We are beyond the reach of a Conviction;</hi> But the Reader may excuſe him a little, being now among his Brethren, the <hi>Grecian Hero's, Alcibiades</hi> and <hi>Pericles.</hi> But who told him this, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> were <hi>beyond the reach of a Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Sure not the Scriptures; For there is no ſuch Sentence in them all; Nor the Spirit, for he cannot indure <hi>Divine Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the Capital Enemy of the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prieſthood:</hi> Who then? Imagination: A thing the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> call Faith; The very counterfeit he hath been talking of juſt now.</p>
               <p>Next he tells us, That <hi>Propheſies of future Events may well be brought to the Scripture Teſt:</hi> Then I beſeech him tell me, what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Teſt could <hi>Noah</hi> his Prophefie of the Flood have been brought to; Or <hi>George
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102472:55"/>
Wiſharts</hi> Propheſie of the Cardinals being Killed in ſuch a place, and not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe, he ſaith, <hi>Paul was Divinely inſpired, and the Actions were conform to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſonant, and warranted by the Promiſe of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;C: But it ſeems he hath forgotten what he ſaid in page 39. Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles proved their Doctrines by the Scriptures, who were <hi>Immediatly inſpired</hi> as well as <hi>Paul;</hi> But any thing will ſerve after ſuch a fatal blow as he hath lately given.</p>
               <p>Page 61. He ſaith, The ground of their Arguments, with which they ſtand and fall is this, <hi>The Scriptures are not the Fountain it ſelf, but a Declaration of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: Therefore they are not to be accounted the principal Original of all Truth and Knowledge, nor vet the adequat Primary Rule of Faith and Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Let the Reader obſerve, That this is but a <hi>Theſe;</hi> And that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries themſelves grant the firſt part of it Reaſon therein adduced: But the Argument to prove the ſecond part, he hath never mentioned, as being too hot for his fingers, Which is this following. <hi>Apol:</hi> page 44.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:102472:55"/>That which is not the Rule of my faith in believing the Scriptures themſelves, is not the <hi>Adequat Primary Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Scriptures are not nor can be the Rule of that Paith by which I believe them, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> This he hath taken no nottice of: But gives us a long Citation out of R: B: his <hi>Vindication,</hi> page 37. And then tells us the Coherence will be made out <hi>Ad Calendas Graecas;</hi> As if it were the Cuſtom when Men <hi>publiſh Theſes</hi> to ſet down in the Body of them, all the Arguments to prove them. But ſeeing he will have a Coherence, let him take it thus. The Scriptures are not the Fountain, but a Declaration of the Founta in, and when the ſtreams fail, men uſe to recurr to the Fountain; Therefore when the Scriptures cannot reſolve the doubts which ordinarly ariſe among Chriſtians, They ought to recurr to the Fountain. That this hath been the practiſe of the Saints in all ages is manifeſt from the Scripture, I ſhall inſtance one or two with divers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited. That <hi>Divid</hi> was a Man of GOD, and Knew the Scriptures; I hope mine Adverſary will not deny, and that he had <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Prieſt with him, to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102472:56"/>
help him to the right ſence of them (if need were) when he was at <hi>Keilab;</hi> Yet he was neceſſitate to recurr to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, &amp; enquire of the Lord: Will <hi>Saul come down?</hi> And will the Man of <hi>Keilab</hi> ver me up unto him, 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 23 9, 10, 11, 12 And again at <hi>Zigl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>g</hi> when the people were like to ſtone him; Did he not then enquire of the LORD, 1 <hi>Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 30. 8 And I would willingly know what the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> means by ſeeking the LORD in theit ſtraits, except it be to ask his Counſel when all other means fail them: Hence all his boaſt evaniſheth</p>
               <p>Next he challengeth his Adverſary, as confounding the principal Rule and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Ground, together calling it None<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, ridiculous, and nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; But he ſhould have remembred that in page 46. He hath cited <hi>Epheſ:</hi> 2. 20. To prove the Scripture to be the Foundation, and all along calls them the Principal Rule: If this be ſenſe, ſo the other.</p>
               <q>Sanum Reprênſor debet habere Caput.</q>
               <p>In page 64. He comes to begg the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>in terminis,</hi> and tells us poſitively, <hi>The
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102472:56"/>
Scriptures are the Primary Rule,</hi> And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, Thus we underſtand the <hi>Primarie Rule,</hi> and while he doth not ſo, ho but miſtaketh the Queſtion. This indeed is imperious <hi>Logick,</hi> and more becoming a <hi>Grecian Hero</hi> then a <hi>Presbyterion Prieſt;</hi> But he muſt Know that the word <hi>Primary</hi> is out of doors. As it ſignifies Firſt, And before he give it another ſignification, he will need to alter all the <hi>Lexicons</hi> I have yet ſeen, For there was a Rule of Faith before there was a Book in the World; And therefore the Scriptures cannot be the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next he comes to his <hi>Acyrologie,</hi> to let us know he hath ſtudied <hi>Rhetorick:</hi> Saying, to call a Perſon of Rule, is a great Induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Confuſion, But to call GOD and Chriſt the habits of Grace (as the doth in page 38) is a far more improper ſpeech.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then he cites R. B's words in anſwer to <hi>J: Brown,</hi> but not fully, and draweth his conſequences from them; the words are theſe. For I was never ſo abſurd, as to call GOD ſimply conſidered, or the Spirit of GOD (<hi>in obſtracto</hi>) (but as imprinting Truths to be believed and obeyed in mens hearts, not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102472:57"/>
contrary, but according to Scripture, for he cannot contradict himſelf the Rule of Chriſtians.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From hence he deduceth two Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the <hi>Quakers</hi> Grand principle, that <hi>Immediate objective Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are the primary Rule of their faith, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to the ground; And that theſe Imprinted truths are but ſecondary.</hi> But who ſeeth not deceit and malice in this conſequence? Certainly he muſt fear his cauſe, when he takes ſuch weak Pillars to underprop it: For any man of candor may ſee that R: B: intendeth only to prove that truths Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, and not the <hi>Imprinter</hi> to be the Rule, And he conſeſſeth it to be one <hi>Acylogie,</hi> or improper ſpeech. And to conclude the Ruine of his Adverſaries cauſe from one improper ſpeech, is either great folly or great malice, ſo that his <hi>Antecedent</hi> being tightly underſtood accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Authors ſenſe, his conſequence together will all he hath deduced from it, is a meer <hi>Non-ſequitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His other <hi>Conſequence</hi> depending upon the firſt falleth with it: Only he hath been aſſert that theſe <hi>Revelations</hi> are <hi>ſelf evident,</hi> and that to aſſert other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes were impious, And (a little after) to judge that the <hi>GOD of Truth may prove
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102472:57"/>
the lyar; and deceive us!</hi> Well then <hi>Patroclus,</hi> it ſeemes there are yet ſuch Revelations by thine own conſeſſion, as are ſelf evident, which we may take notice of in due time.</p>
               <p>He proceeds, ſaying, <hi>There is very good reaſon to wonder why any Revelation ſhould be more primarie then the Scriptures, both being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the ſame ſpirit, ſeeing the primarineſs is not the immediateneſs, but the thief binding power, and the prerogative to be the Touch-ſtone of all doctrines?</hi> But who denyeth this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to the Scriptures, of being a Rule to try all Doctrines of Men how holy ſo ever? Have not his Adverſaries granted all this times? And what then, I hope to believe this propoſition is an Act of Faith no where mentioned in Scripture, neither is it ſelf evident, and therefore needeth a Rule: Yea more, the <hi>ſcriptures</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> make mention of a Rule only three times, to wit. 2 Cor. 10. 15, 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 16. And if <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troclus</hi> with all his prudence and wiſdom comparing Scripture with Scripture, can twiſt and twine a ſenſe out of theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to prove his matter, he may boaſt of it.</p>
               <p>Next, he cites 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17. in theſe words, <hi>they are able to make the man of GOD
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102472:58"/>
wiſe unto ſalvation.</hi> But whether there be ſuch words there, let the Reader judge; Then he plainly ſheweth us what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, and it is the book in the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of which we ought finally and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be true, then certainly the Tennor of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> is made void, and they who lived under the Law had a rea. dier acceſs unto GOD, and to know His Mind then they who live under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <p>And yet the difference is evident, for as the Law was an outward Rule written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the outward Leader of outward <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> ſo CHRIST the <hi>SpiritualLeader of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Iſrael</hi> writteth His <hi>Spiritual Law in the heart.</hi>

               <p>I ſhall add one argument thus, That which was a Rule to the <hi>Faith-makers</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in compoſing their form of Faith, and impoſing it upon the Nations, may ſerve to be a Rule to the preſent <hi>Presbyterian Churehes.</hi>

               <p>But their thinking it in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be truth, was their Rule. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Hence it is evident, That their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was their Rule; But how it was inſtructed to diſcern Truth from Errour, whether by the Divine Spirit or by Humane Prudence and Wiſdom, let <hi>Patroclus</hi> chooſe, And to help him in his Election, he may conſult his Brother, the Author of <hi>Melius Inquirendum:</hi> who a little after he hath told him, that his <hi>ultimate</hi> Rule is a <hi>monſter,</hi> Tells him alſo, <hi>That nothing can poſſiblie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe between the Authoritie of GOD and the conſcience, and that its dictates are uncontrollable.</hi>

               <p>As for his phraſe, GOD ſpeaking in the Scriptures, and a little after, The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD ſpeaking in the Scriptures; It is an Acyrologie which will need a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary: For that GOD ſpoke the Scriptures to the Prophets and Apoſtles who wrote them, and that he ſpeaks them now to his Servants in their Hearts at times to their great comfort, is confeſſed; But that he ſpeaks in the Scripture is a phraſe hard to be underſtood, and in effect, a meer ſham to amuſe his Reader. As for example, When <hi>Patro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But let the Reader know, That we ful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly owne the <hi>Spirit of GOD,</hi> which gave forth the Scriptures to be his <hi>own Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> neither do we deny the uſe of <hi>Lawful Means,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Reading, Meditation, Prayer,</hi> and waiting to know the <hi>Mind of the LORD</hi> in the <hi>Seriptures,</hi> as many of our Friends have publiſhed to the World.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102472:61"/>
The groſſeſt of <hi>Popiſh ſhifts</hi> to defend the groſſeſt of <hi>Popiſh Doctrine. Anſwer,</hi> If this be true, then <hi>Patroclus</hi> is a great Liar; For in page 32. he ſaith, <hi>The Papiſts have gone too low, reſolving their Faith ultimatly in Men; The Quakers on the other hand attempting to go too high, have contracted a Vertigo:</hi> And in that foregoing page, placeth themſelves in the middle. So that by his own confeſſion he muſt be nearer a kin to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> then we. And in good earneſt, any who are acquainted well with their Principles and Practiſes, will find the Difference nothing but Pretence. For as the <hi>Popiſh Doctors</hi> are the Makers and Rulers of the <hi>Popiſh Faith;</hi> ſo the <hi>Presbyterian Doctors</hi> are the Makers and Rulers of the <hi>Presbyterian Faith,</hi> and no leſs angry perſecuters of all Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Only (Bleſſed be the LORD) they have not ſuch power.</p>
               <p>As for his ſaying, <hi>We charge all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches as Enemies to the Spirit of GOD, becauſe they try all Doctrines and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This contains two Lyes; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we condemn all the <hi>Reſormed Churches;</hi> For R: B: hath cited ſeverals of them who are of his Judgement, and more may be cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its place. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſou
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102472:61"/>
is a groſs Lye; For we alwayes own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That all Doctrines and Practiſes of Men were to be tryed by the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next he ſaith, Hence we find, <hi>That the spirit of the Quakers is Diametrically oppoſite is the scriptures, and therefore the ſpirit of lyes and deluſion:</hi> Whence I pray thee <hi>Patroelus?</hi> Becauſe we reject private <hi>Presbyterion Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations;</hi> Which are but Mans wit and work: This Conſequence will be made out (as thou ſayeſt) <hi>ad Kalendas Graecas.</hi> When in a vapouring humour he giveth a <hi>Latine phraſe,</hi> and maketh us <hi>Ghoſts</hi> and <hi>Hobgoblins;</hi> But he hath not yet fallen u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the right ſpell to conjureus, except it be his cutting our Juglar Veins, which he yet wants power, tho not will to do.</p>
               <p>His next oſ any weight is, That from our <hi>denying their Interpretations;</hi> It follows, That our Saviovr laboured invain, when he proved the Reſurrection of the Dead from the <hi>scriptures:</hi> But he might have conſidered, that he was GOD as well as Man who ſpoke there, and that his Word was ſufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this <hi>Scripture</hi> was an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <hi>ad bominem</hi> to the <hi>Sadducees</hi> who believed <hi>Moſes</hi> Law better then Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Conſequence will be very
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102472:62"/>
groſs, That becauſe Chriſt who had the Spirit above meaſure, proved an Article of Faith by Scripture; Therefore every <hi>Presbyterian Prieſt pedant</hi> may by his own natural and acquired parts, without the Spirit interpret Scripture. But there is at preſent too great contraverſie which ſeems to bring a firie brand in the tail of it, like to deſtroy all that is profitable or beautyſul in the Nation (as it hath once already done) and to hazard the lives and eſtates of many well meaning men and good Patriots; <hi>That is, whether there be any difference betwixt the office of a Biſhop and a Presbyter in the Church?</hi> Now if our Author can decide this contraverſie by Scripture to the ſilence of the <hi>Malignants,</hi> as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did the <hi>Sadduſees,</hi> he will do better ſervice to his <hi>Native Country,</hi> then by all his weak and deceitful wranglings againſt the poor Quakers, who are not compeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him for the Chair.</p>
               <p>But his next conſequence is very odd; Yea ſaith he, <hi>if this Doctrine be true: A man doth not ſin if he worſhip the Grocodale; l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, Dog, or Cat, with the old Aegyptians: Yea, a man may believe or do whatſoever cometh in his Brain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:102472:62"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>' This Doctrine that the Spirit of GOD is the only true interpreter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can bring no ſuch conſequence along with it; For GOD never taught a man to commit Idolatry, and to ſay that a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral prohibation is not binding upon a man becauſe his name is not in it, is redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and no man that I know, ever thought it. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> If his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be true, then no Idolater ſinned before Moſes Law was written; Yea (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Author) the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> he ſpeaks of did not ſin: For if they had, no <hi>inward Law,</hi> ſure they had no <hi>outward Law;</hi> And (<hi>borreſco referens!</hi>) the old World ſinned not to deſerve the Flood, becauſe they had no written <hi>Law,</hi> nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Presbyterian Prieſt</hi> to interperate <hi>ſcripture.</hi> Next he ſayes <hi>we deny all Commentaries and expofitions of ſcripture;</hi> He ſhould have added which are meerly mans work without the Spirit of Chriſt, if he will not be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a liar.</p>
               <p>Then he chargeth <hi>R: B:</hi> for laying <hi>that the Holy Ghoſt is not a diſtinct Perſon of the Trinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I ſhall ſet down <hi>R: B's:</hi> own words that the Reader may ſee how fairly he deals with <hi>R: B:</hi> Thus, I deſire to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102472:63"/>
know of him in what Scripture he finds theſe words, that the Spirit is a dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Perſon of the Trinity; For I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Spirit of GOD proceed eth from the Father and the Son, and is GOD: And then asketh him whether any hath reaſon to think he truely makes the Scripture the Rule of his Faith (notwithſtanding his pretence) when he either will not, or cannot find words in it to expreſs the chief Articles of his Creed</q> And now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther R: B: hath not fully confeſſed the the Myſtrie, and only denyed words of mans invention, let the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>Next he challengeth him for taking the words, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. At the firſt ſound, and without any explication, but he hath no leaſure to give us any explication, nor to diſprove what he ſaid from the words; But concludes thus, <hi>So that what ever they ſay, or can ſay to liberate their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine from this moſt weighty, but juſt charge they ſhall only twiſt contradictions the faſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a great blow from a <hi>Graecian Gallant,</hi> but hath not the weight of a Fear ther: For we own the ſcripture for a Rule, and the beſt outward Rule in the World,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102472:63"/>
and yet diſown the <hi>Presbyterian expoſitions,</hi> and Commentaries on them, ſo long as they deny the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit in the work. And whereas he challengeth us <hi>for not writing Commentaries;</hi> The World is ſo overloaded with Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of Mans making, each almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting another upon the ſame text; that we think it beſt to let <hi>Patroclus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in his own ſenſe, till GOD reveal that alſo unto him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
               <p>After this for about a page, he doth noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but rail and rove at randum, as if <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elus</hi> like he had the <hi>Trojans</hi> in chaſe, and were upon execution; And to ſum up his Victory, he concludes us <hi>Bapiſts,</hi> becauſe forſooth, we deny the <hi>Scriptures to be the principal Rule of Faith and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer:</hi> Firſt, He hath need here of ſome of his Metaphiſical formalities to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Rule or Law, and the Judge, But this we may expect next: The Reaſon he giveth is, becauſe our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments (as he alleageth) conclude with theirs, and inſtanceth that of <hi>Revel:</hi> 22: 18: compared with <hi>Deut: 4: 2:</hi> but hath brought nothing to diſprove the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; Only telling us, to this purpoſe

may <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwer, and the reſt of the <hi>Jeſuites:</hi> But the difference lyeth here, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> would thereby ſet up the <hi>Roman Church</hi> and <hi>unwritten Traditions</hi> to be the <hi>primary rule;</hi> But we the <hi>Teachings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of</hi> CHRIST: ſo that according to <hi>patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus</hi> own words, in page 32, we differ as far as Heaven and Earth; And he hath choſen a middle place for himſelf and his Brethren, in which of the <hi>Limbos</hi> he may tell us next: And let this ſuffice to anſwer all his Rovings to the end of the Chapter.</p>

ſo render them the object of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſeverity, Or expoſe them to the rage of his beloved <hi>Reformers,</hi> the <hi>Rabble.</hi> For, Firſt, he ſaies, <hi>they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the guidance of the Spirit of GOD,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his wonted phraſe, ſpeaking in the Scriptures.

               <p>Next he adds, And again in contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this, the Soul of CHRIST Extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Dilated</p>
               <p>This is a part of <hi>George Keiths</hi> Book, called, <hi>The way caſt up;</hi> To which book he promiſeth an Anſwer: But the Man is able, and can anſwer for himſelf againſt all the <hi>Preſbyterian Prieſts</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

               <p>Then he ſayes, But moſt frequently, they call it the <hi>Light within,</hi> or <hi>ſimply, the Spirit.</hi> And it not this Scripture Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.

called ſimply the Spirit without any addition?</p>
               <p>But he adds to which <hi>Spirit GOD himſelf ſpeaking in the Scriptures muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But I paſs by the reſt of his railing, and come to his defence of his Brother <hi>John Browns</hi> Argument, which is this; <q>If ſince the Apoſtles fell a ſleep, and the Cannon of the Scripture was cloſed; All that have pretended to immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation as a <hi>Primary Rule,</hi> have been led by a <hi>Spirit of errour,</hi> then it is not the way of CHRIST.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But the former is true, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To which <hi>R: B:</hi> hath anſwered, and our Author accepts his anſwer, and changeth the argument thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If ſince the Apoſtles, whoſe names are mentioned in Scripture fell a ſleep, and <hi>John</hi> wrote <hi>the Revelation,</hi> all that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to this Kynd of <hi>Revelation</hi> have been led by a ſpirit of error; Then this is not the wayof Chriſt: But the former is true. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And now he thinketh there can be no
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102472:66"/>
exception againſt his argument, but that it will certainly do his buſineſs, yet is he like to be miſtaken.</p>
               <p>For firſt his argument ſeems to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate that before the Apoſtles fell a ſleep, immediate Revelation was the <hi>Primary Rule,</hi> and if it was ſo, it continues to be ſo yet, by his own former Conceſſions: For GOD hath not changed his Rule; ſo that if he makes his argument to ſpeak to the purpoſe, he muſt ſay thus, all who pretended to this kind of Revelation, as well before as ſince the Apoſtles fell a ſleep were led by a Spirit of error, which I think he would be loath to affirm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He will gain very little tho I grant his argument <hi>in terminis,</hi> for I have as little kindneſs, for pretenders as he hath or can have; and do readily grant that all who pretend to this kynd of Revelations and have them not, are led by a Spirit of error, as well as that all <hi>Presbyterians</hi> who pretend to the Scriptures for their Rule, and do not frame their Faith and manners according to them, are Hipocrites, and are led by a ſpirit of error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that except his Argument ſay, all who have been led really and truely by the Spirit of Truth (of whom Chriſt promiſed that <hi>he ſhould

Or that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are led by a ſpirit of errour; Becauſe the <hi>Lutheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Anabaptiſts, Independants,</hi> and <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> pretend to the ſame Rule with them? So as the Scriptures may be wreſted to the condemnation of the Wreſters; Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor muſt confeſs that he needs a Guide to tell him when he goeth aſtray.</p>

               <p>He falls next to prove, that there is no <hi>Conſanguinity betwixt the Jeſuits argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Jo: Menzies,</hi> and this of <hi>J: B:</hi> But let the Reader conſider whether both Arguments terminate in the ſame thing; For the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> preſſeth <hi>J: M:</hi> to produce his Grounds and Principles; And our Author in page 78<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaith his Argument is demonſtrative, except his Adverſary can produce any Inſtance to the contrary; And if this be no <hi>Conſanguinity,</hi> let the Reader judge.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102472:68"/>
none of them could pretend to an outward call to preach the <hi>Proteſtant Doctrine and Worſhip;</hi> And yet they both preached it, and I believe upon a better Ground than a <hi>Presbyterian Call.</hi> But however, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor does not deny that theſe Men had <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Revelation;</hi> And conſequently his ſerious Truth abſurdly affirmed by <hi>James Durbame;</hi> Viz: <hi>That Chriſt hath ſpoke his laſt words to his Church,</hi> is a fabulous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.</p>
               <p>Next, he falls again upon <hi>James Naylor;</hi> And becauſe R: B: ſaith, <hi>He repented again,</hi> our Author draws a Noble Conſequence from it, thus, Which <hi>Anſwer</hi> is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Confirmation of what we plead for, To wit, <hi>That the Quakers ſpirit is ready to give them the cheat and deceive them;</hi> For I believe J: N: acted but according to his Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is juſt as much as to ſay, he that ſinneth againſt the Law of GOD and repenteth, he evidently confirmeth that the Law of GOD hath given him the cheat and deceived him, <hi>Abſit Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further, About the beginning of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> your Miniſters had ſworn Canonical Obedience to their Ordinaries; Then they ſwore the Extirpation of them
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102472:69"/>
&amp; their Office. And about twenty years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſwore again Canonical Obedience; In all which Three <hi>contrary Oaths,</hi> they pretended the Scripture for their Rule. Was it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture which gave them the cheat and deceived them? No ſurely. <hi>So James Nayler</hi> ſinned againſt his Light; and the Law of GOD in his heart, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented and confeſſed, he had ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Light, and condemned himſelf under his hand, (tho this malicious man inſinuates the contrary) which I doubt he can ſay of few of his Brethren, who <hi>perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves in taking the Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid, he drawes three Conſequences, <hi>firſt,</hi> his ſerious truth before mentioned, to wit, <hi>That CHRIST hath ſpoken his laſt words to his Church;</hi> And to help his Brother out of this Quagmire, he adds, <hi>That is put a cloſe to theſe writtings which were to be a Rule to the whole Church;</hi> being aſhamed to deny, that there were <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Divine Revelations</hi> after the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> being ſo much teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to in Church Hiſtory: And themſelves having called <hi>Samuel Rutherfoord</hi> a great <hi>Seer,</hi> much upon his Maſters ſecreets.

                  <hi>Daphine,</hi> comes very near to aſſure us of an age at hand, <hi>Wherein we ſhall have Men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>a, and able to work Miracles;</hi> And in his Book upon the <hi>Revelation,</hi> tells us, <hi>That the firſt Reformation begun by Luther;</hi> (which he calls the <hi>Harveſt) was carried on by the Miniſtry of Men;</hi> But the ſecond which is yet to come, he calls the <hi>Vintage,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>It will be by the Inſpiration of GOD;</hi> And in his Characters of the Kingdom of CHRIST, he gives for one of them, <hi>That there ſhall be a plentifull pouring out of the Spirit, whereof</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>That which the Apoſtles received at Jeruſalem was but a Type.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could inſtance many others, ſome who have had it, and others who have foretold of it; But this being a Modern Writer, a <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> and a Sufferer, well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of by all <hi>proteſtants,</hi> I thought might ſuffice to ſhew, that all the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not this ſerious Truth, as he call it.</p>
               <p>His two following Conſequences dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from his Argument formerly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Refuted, are of no force; For (bleſſed be the LORD) we can inſtance Thouſands who neither have fallen into palpable Errors, nor open Blaſphemy; Nor have marks of GOD's heavy Judgements,

               <p>His third Conſequence being a meer windie bauble, deſerves no anſwer.</p>
               <p>

hearts, and would not believe it? The ſame is the caſe with our Author, and his Brethren at this day.</q> But perhaps he expecteth miracles for Proofs and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; And in this followeth the footſtepts of his predeceſtors the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who dealth ſo by the firſt <hi>Reformers:</hi> And the ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> gave to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may ſerve him: For as they ſaid, <hi>They needed not Miracles becauſe they preached not a New Goſpel:</hi> So we pretend not <hi>Revelations</hi> of <hi>New Things,</hi> But a New <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Good old things: And again what can he pretend to that we want?

Secondly, <hi>That he ownes the Revelations which</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Leyden <hi>pretended to to be a Rule.</hi> And thirdly, <hi>That he denyeth the Scriptures to be a Rule.</hi> All which three are groſs and notorious Lyes, unworthy of a man of any Candor or Honeſty.</p>
               <p>His <hi>ſecond</hi> Propoſition is drawn from theſe words of R: B: And indeed this is a fine Argument he hath produced for <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> for it renders all Faith, even that of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> uncertain: For ſince their ground and warrand for writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture was in his own account, <hi>Inward, Immediat, and extraordinary Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And if ſuch be, as he affirms, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, then the Truth of the Scriptures which depends upon ſuch, muſt neceſſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be uncertain. Now the man certainly knew that R: B: was pleading for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Revelation, but <hi>Divine, Inward,</hi> and <hi>Immediat Revelations:</hi> But being ſtraitned by this Anſwer, he betakes himſelf to the covers of Deceit, and the refuge of Lyes for his Reply inſtead of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102472:72"/>
the Spirit of GOD (which he knew his Adverſary meant) he puts in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of <hi>Jobn of Leyden;</hi> Which impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent treachery is obvious to Reader at firſt view.</p>
               <p>Hence he might conclude, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Micajah</hi> wrought no Miracles to prove his propheſie more then the Prieſts of <hi>Achab</hi> did, therefore he was not to be believed: And becauſe <hi>Jobn Huſs, George Wiſhart,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Rutherfoord,</hi> wrought to Miracles; Therefore they were no more to be truſted then <hi>Jobn of Leyden;</hi> For Miracles only excepted, I know no proofs he can lay claim to, but we can do the ſame.</p>
               <p>But the beſt is, That in page 80, he would father theſe Deductions upon his Adverſary; Saying, <hi>And now Reader, ſpeak thy mind in good earneſt; Thinkeſt thou that this man was in his Witt, or to be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Rationals, when he made theſe Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> &amp;c. Truly he is very weak Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, That ſeeth not this mans affronted deceit; And ſeeing the Deductions are intirely his own and none of R: B's: He muſt (by his own Confeſſion) be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among Brutes: And whereas he ſaith, That J: B: never called the Revelations
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102472:73"/>
of the Prophets uncertain; He ſhould have told what hath made Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation uncertain now, which he cannot; Or have proven that it is altogether ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which he dare not undertake, tho it be an Article of his Faith. And thus by denying the certainty of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (for R: B: pleads for none elſe) let the Reader judge if lie have not laboured to confirm his Brothers Atgument for <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Seepticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>page</hi> 81. He thinks to put an end to the contraverſie by ſome poſitions, whereof the firſt is to this purpoſe; <hi>We cannot know whether they have any Revelation at all, They may be lyeing unto us: For any thing we know, we have only their naked words for it; whereas on the other hand, it is beyond denyal that we have the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This had been very ſuitable language for their predeceſtors, The <hi>Jews</hi> when they ſtoned the <hi>Proto-Martyr Stephen, Acts</hi> 7. 56. When he ſaid, <hi>Behold I ſee the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens opened, and the Son of Man ſtanding on the Right Hand of GOD;</hi> And for <hi>Joaſh</hi> the King, when he cauſed <hi>Zachariah</hi> to be ſtoned to Death, and for <hi>Achab</hi> to <hi>Mieajab,</hi> and many other of the Prophets who wrought no Miracles to prove their Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102472:73"/>
But <hi>Chriſts ſheep bear his voice, and know it from the voice of a ſtranger, whom they will not follow;</hi> Tho ravenous Wolves in Sheeps cloathing, neither can not will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be his voice: And whereas he ſaith, <hi>it is beyond denyal that we have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> Is it not beyond denyal, that we have them alſo? Or do any who profeſs Chriſtianity want them? Or what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage have they by them, which others have not; Except it be to make a ſordid Tarde of ſelling their Interpretations of them. So that we dare attempt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion very eaſily, thus the <hi>Lutherians, Independants, Baptiſts, Socinians,</hi> and <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> &amp;c: had the Scriptures as well as the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have them; So that the Controverſy is only, Who have the true ſenſe of them, each party pretending to it. And now I ask him, what infallible Signs, Evidences, and Proofs can he give, to the conviction and ſelf condemnation of the greateſt Oppoſers (as he words it) to demonſtrate that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and none elſe have the true ſenſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Which till he do, the retortion ſtands good.</p>
               <p>But to take his words as they lye, I can compare them to nothing better then to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102472:74"/>
                  <hi>the words of the Phariſees,</hi> Joh: 9. 29. <hi>We know that GOD ſpake by Moſes, as for this fellow, we know not from whence be is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſecond is, <hi>It being given, that they have Revelations of ſome kind; From whence are they? From Heaven? Their own fancy, or from hell?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> We plead for no Revelations, but ſuch as are Divine; And therefore, as his Queſtion is blaſphemous, ſo it is no leſs impertinent then to ſay; It being giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that <hi>Patroelus</hi> is a Man, from whence is he? Whether the ſon of a Man, or a horſe, or of a mad Dogg? But he proves they are not from Heaven, becauſe they are common to all men; Yet, <hi>Bonum quo communius co melius, Chriſt hath enlightned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man coming into the World, and GOD is juſt,</hi> He never puniſhed a man for breach of a Law, which he never made known to him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he ſaith, <hi>If they have Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, we know not for what end they are given; Whether to be a principal Rule or not, whether by their own corruptions they do not wreſt and miſunderſtand them; Or if they walk according to them? Nothing of which can be ſaid of the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer firſt,</hi> For what end they are given,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102472:74"/>
                  <hi>Job: 14. 26. To teach you all things.</hi> And 16. 13. <hi>He will guide you into all Truth:</hi> And that they are the <hi>principal Rule,</hi> is ſufficiently proved before. The <hi>ſecond</hi> part is an impudent ſelf contradiction, where he ſaith, <hi>That wreſting or miſunderſtanding, through corruption cannot be ſaid of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> Whereas he hath frequently cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf before, with ſaying, in the <hi>very</hi> foregoing page next ſave one, <hi>That the Scriptures, through mans corruption are ſubject to abuſe,</hi> never man denyed; Thus goeth he backward and foreward. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He ſaith, <hi>They know not if we walk according to them:</hi> But we well know, that they walk not according to the Scriptures; And it's ſtrange with what impudency the man can obtrude ſuch ſayings upon the World. He would inſinuate in page 79. That they ſquared their practice exactly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures, and here he would have us walk according to <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Whereas they have told the World in their <hi>Larger Catechiſm; That no man is able to keep GOD's Commands by any Grace received in this Life.</hi> Then he giveth us the reaſon of his Ignorance thus; <hi>For we can hear nothing nor ſee nothing,</hi> &amp;c: Who can help his ſpiritual deaſneſs and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102472:75"/>
None but the <hi>Spiritual Phyſitian</hi> of Souls whom he is rejecting.</p>
               <p>In page 82. He cometh to the Judge of contraverſy; where he laboureth to prove two things, <hi>Viz: That the Spirit of God cannot be a Judge of Contraverſy; And that the Scriptures are apt to be a Judge of Contraverſy;</hi> Which he dares not to ſay abſolutely, but for removal of differences about things contained in them.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon he gives is, <hi>Becauſe two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parties may both of them adduce Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to prove contradictory aſſertions; And that the one of them cannot evince his Revelations to be from GOD, more then the other.</hi> This is the ſubſtance of what he ſaith againſt the Spirit, and for the Scriptures he ſaith thus: Now, this Argument can in no wayes be retorted on the Scriptures; For tho there hath been, through the corruption of men, wreſting of Scripture in any Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; And that even among theſe who aſſert the Scripture to be the <hi>Principal Rule of Faith and Manners;</hi> Yet, who can ſay, That this is through default of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; ſeing our Adverſarys cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that they ſpeak both ſenſe and Truth, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> And a little after, ſo that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102472:75"/>
there ſhall follow a mutual agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two diſſenting parties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let the Reader obſerve his ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contradiction, Saying, <hi>The Scriptures may be wreſted by the corruption of men;</hi> And yet in page 81. He ſaith, <hi>Nothing of this can be ſaid of the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>be confeſseth</hi> (becauſe he cannot deny it) <hi>that there have been</hi> (and yet are) <hi>wreſting of Scriptures, and many Contraverſies even among ſuch as aſsert the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the principal Rule of Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> And therefore it is evident, that his concluſion falls, <hi>Viz:</hi> ſo that there ſhall follow a mutual agreement betwixt the two diſſenting parties; For this agreement hath neither followed, nor is like to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by all his endeavours.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Scriptures can never give a ſentence, being but a Law; And every Law needs a Judge to determine. But the matter is in plain terms, we muſt admit the General Aſſembly to be Judge, which will determine and convince, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Spirit, nor by Scripture, nor by Reaſon; But by <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Furie, Ares, halters, Fire</hi> and <hi>Sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If this had been true, all the difference among <hi>Proteſtants</hi> would have
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102472:76"/>
come to a mutual agreement before now, or elſe he muſt ſay, They are all corrupt men, except the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for what he faith of the <hi>Ranters</hi> (who learned from you to make GOD Author of all their wicked actions) their fruits make them manifeſt, as your fruits do you, notwithſtanding of both your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
               <p>In page 83. He ſaith, <hi>We have heard their Retortions,</hi> Let us now hear their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Anſwer; That their fruits declare them to have the Spirit of GOD; For which forſooth, they bring Scripture Proof from <hi>Matthew,</hi> 7. 15. 16. Where <hi>fruits</hi> are made the <hi>Teſt</hi> for trying whether one be a <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe prophet. Thus he,</hi> And then falls a railing with great bitterneſs, lies and falſe accuſations, which is always his laſt Refuge when he is ſtraitned. But let the Reader obſerve, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he mocks at Scripture proof (tho he dare not deny it) adding a <hi>Forſooth</hi> to it, as if none had right to the Scripture but <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Prieſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That for Fruits, he enumerats four groſs and abominable Untruths, wherewith he chargeth us. To witt, That we deny the <hi>Holy Trinity, the Perſon of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102472:76"/>
our Lord JESUS CHRIST, The Reſurrection of the Body, and that we aſsert the Souls of Men, yea, and devils too, to be GOD Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> Of all which he ſaith, he will prove the <hi>Quakers</hi> to be undenyably guilty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he end <hi>his Treatiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This needs no Anſwer, But to ſay. <hi>The Lord rebuke this lying ſpirit which hath gone forth in the mouth of this lying falſe Accuſer:</hi> For the LORD GOD whom we ſerve, knoweth our Innocency in this matter; and will in his due time vindicat his people from theſe malicious Callumniators.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Man might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that theſe are points of Faith and not of Works, and that our Saviour ſpoke here of Works, and not Faith only. The moſt wicked Man in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may believe all the <hi>Weſtminſter Creed</hi> as well as <hi>Patroclus</hi> doth, and yet receive the Sentence in verſe 23. of the ſame Chapter, <hi>Depart from me ye workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> And therefore, tho he ſhould add another <hi>Forſooth</hi> to it, I will betake me to the Fruits mentioned in Scripture, and then let the World (which he ſayes is not ignorant) judge between them and us. <hi>Galat:</hi> 5. 20. Where theſe are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned for <hi>Fruits of the Fleſh, Variance, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102472:77"/>
Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Envyings, Murthers.</hi> &amp;c. Which whither they have been peculiar to that <hi>Tribe,</hi> let the Nation judge. On the other hand the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the Spirit are <hi>Love, Peace, Joy, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance,</hi> &amp;c. And whether the people, in deriſion called <hi>Quakers,</hi> be found in the Exerciſe of ſuch Fruits, let ſuch as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guainted with their converſations, bear Witneſs for or againſt them. And I may ſay without reflection, if to devour and deſtroy, be the fruits of <hi>Abbadon</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollyon,</hi> Theſe are the only Spirits, the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Fruits can lay claim to; which to enumerat, were to writ a hiſtory, but the late Advocat <hi>George Maekenzie</hi> hath given an Epitome of them, to which I refer the Reader:</p>
               <p>In page 84. He chargeth R. B. with three lies; Citing his <hi>Vindication;</hi> But how groundleſsly, will be evident to any who will be at the pains to examine R. B's. words, to which for brevity I refer the Reader. Only this, the firſt is as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>John Browns,</hi> as his two Hypothetick propoſitions are his own, in page 79. To which R B. anſwers, what a horrible lie is this? The Second is no lie, For in <hi>chap:</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:102472:77"/>
3 <hi>Num:</hi> 2. Of the <hi>Weſtminerr Confeſſion</hi> we have theſe words. <hi>Altho GOD knows what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may or can come to paſs upon all ſuppoſed Conditions, yet he hath not decreed anything, becauſe be foreſaw it as future, or as, that it would come to paſs upon ſuch conditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the very next words, they add <hi>By the Decree of GOD for the Manifeſtation of His Glory, ſome men and Angels are predeſtinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto everlaſting Life, and others fore ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto everlaſting death.</hi> Let him interpret this with the next, for if it bear not all that R. B. ſaith, it is no better then the Anſwers of the <hi>Delphick Oracle.</hi> So that which he calls a palpable and horrid Lie, will be found to be a manifeſt Truth to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that can read the <hi>Confeſfion</hi> above cited.</p>
               <p>His <hi>third</hi> is that I. B. <hi>makes a preaching to the devil,</hi> to deny which, is impudence with a Witneſs: And as for railing in pulpit and print, it is too well known to the Nation to ſeek to cover it. Whereof <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Mackquare</hi> are two famons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, neither is our Author a Novice in that ignoble art, wherein leſt he ſhould come ſhort of his Brethren, he giveth us a ſhort parralel between the old <hi>Libertine
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102472:78"/>
Anabaptiſts,</hi> and the new, who are known by the name of <hi>Quakers,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>is an old blaſt from a new horn,</hi> a work already done by <hi>George Meldrum,</hi> when he was Preacher at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and fully anſwered by <hi>George Keith</hi> without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, To which I might remit my Reader, but becauſe it is not yet printed I ſhall touch at ſome of them, and it is to be ſuſpected not without cauſe, that the hand of <hi>Joab</hi> is in all this.</p>
               <p>His <hi>firſt</hi> is, That theſe men ſaid, <hi>The Word of GOD was a certain heavenlie thing diſtinct from the Scriptures:</hi> Adding, the ſame is the downright Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> What was their Doctrine I know not, for I ſee little ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Adverſaries did not belie them more then that our Adverſaries do not belie us now: which they are not aſhamed to do in the face of the Sun, but our Doctrine is well known to be, That <hi>Chriſt is the Word of GOD,</hi> according to the Scriptures and that the <hi>Scriptures, are the words of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>ſecond is about immediat Revelation,</hi> But our Doctrine on this head is ſufficient. ly cleared in the foregoing Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>His <hi>third is, That the expreſs words and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102472:78"/>
phraſes of the Scripture is to be adhered to without anie expoſition, interpretation, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction:</hi> That is a groſs Callumny may be ſeen in page 67. of his own Book, where he accuſeth <hi>George Keith of poperie</hi> for rejecting their interpretations without the Spirtt; And it is manifeſt we have always contended that the Spirit was the only true Interpreter of hard Scriptures, where they were heard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and that the expreſs Words were to be adhered to, where plain.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Fourth is,</hi> that we aſſert, <hi>that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing recorded in the old Teſtament is binding and incumbent to us, but as it is ratified by CHRIST in the new, and hath precept or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from it:</hi> For which he citeth R: B's: vindication, <hi>page</hi> 178. <hi>Num:</hi> 5. And to ſhow the Reader his baſe ingenuity; I ſhall tranſcribe R: B's words, which are theſe: <q>He ſeeks maliciouſly to inferr that I deny all authority of the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> which is a horid callumny: But ſince there are many things therein, which himſelf will acknowledge, are not binding upon us now; What ſhall be the Rule whereby we ſhall judge what we are now tyed to, and what not: <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:102472:79"/>If this be to deny the obligation of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> or to ſay it is abrogat, let the Reader judge: But it ſeems our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thinketh the <hi>Ninth Commandement</hi> to be abrogated, elſe he would not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently bear falſe witneſs againſt his Neighbour.</p>
               <p>His fifth inſlance of Original ſin, he referreth to his third Chapter, and ſo ſhall I.</p>
               <p>His ſixth is, <hi>That Chriſt made no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſins,</hi> and compared them who taught the contrary to the <hi>Seribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> to aſſert which of the people called <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> is groſs and deteſtable injuſtice, forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and malice: But to cover this, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth another no leſs falſe as to us, that it is damnable and dangerous Doctrine to aſſert <hi>that we are juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Which he promiſeth to prove in his fifth Chapter, but will never be able to prove any thing like theſe two calumnies againſt us, as I hope ſhall be ſeen in its place.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Seventh</hi> is, that they <hi>aſſerted the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of fulfilling the Law:</hi> If he had ſaid that we <hi>aſſert a poſſibility of keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of GOD</hi> (not of our ſelves, but) <hi>through the Grace of GOD.</hi> We own this
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102472:79"/>
charge, and think it no error, but a ſound and great Truth. As for the word <hi>Law</hi> we are not under the Law but under Grace; And here according to his cuſtom, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts a groſs lie upon R. B: ſaying, <hi>for the denyal of which R: B: promiſed continually to rail upon all the Reformed.</hi> It ſeems the man hath dreamed this: For I am certain he can never tell where or to whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed any ſuch thing; What he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in his fourth Chapter, we ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll ſee how he proves it.</p>
               <p>His <hi>eight</hi> inſtance is, <hi>that they denyed the perſeverance of the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this, he alſo miſrepreſents us, for we have alwayes aſſerted, that there is a ſtate of <hi>Confirmation in Grace, attainable by all, and attained by in any, which cannot be fallen from: And that ſome have made ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of Faith and a good conſcience cannot be denyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Ninth</hi> inſtance is, their <hi>denving of the Reſurrection of the ſame body,</hi> and referts to the fifth Chapter of his book: But whatever the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in I <hi>Corinth:</hi> 15. We do willingly believe and acknowledge, and if this Man hath any thing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto him, concerning the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, then what <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, he will do well to publiſh it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:102472:80"/>His <hi>Tenth</hi> is, that they <hi>deny the Sacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and the <hi>Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> which he alſo deceitfully chargeth upon us, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to his <hi>4th</hi> Chapter, wherein I hope his deceit ſhall be detected. The Juſt GOD who ſearcheth our hearts, and knoweth the contrary will certainly reward this <hi>falſe accuſer,</hi> according to his work, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he repent.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Eleventh</hi> inſtance is, That they aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>The Miniſters of the Goſpel ought not to be tyed to the explaining of the ſcriptures, that all in the Church ought to ſpeak by turns,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that the Miniſters ought to have no certain Stepend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This inſtance hath three accuſations; To the firſt, we ſay, <hi>If any man ſpeak let him ſpeak as the Oracles of GOD, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Grace given him, ſo let him Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter:</hi> Not that we are againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of ſcripture by a Miniſter, as he is led thereto by the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> But that in his Preaching he ſhould be tyed thereto only, we ſee no reaſon for it, for either this tye upon him is by <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Humane authority:</hi> If by <hi>Divine authority,</hi> let our author produce it, and it ſhall be no more diſputed; And if by <hi>human au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> (as indeed the whole <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:102472:80"/>
Miniſtry is) Then this tye is not binding upon any true Goſpel Miniſter; But he may <hi>teach, exhort, admoniſh</hi> as GOD giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him utterance, not contrary, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, without taking a Text, and telling his own dark imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations from it.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Second</hi> accuſation is, <hi>that all in the Church ought to ſpeak by turns,</hi> This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther groſs lie, for we never ſaid that all in the Church ought to ſpeak, but we are not aſhamed with <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, 1 <hi>Corinth: 14. 13. For yee may all Propheſie one by one,</hi> (yet not all in the Church) for as the ſame Apoſtle ſayeth, <hi>No man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Third</hi> accuſation is, <hi>That the Miniſters ought not to have certain Stipend:</hi> It is ſtrange that this malicious adverſary can repreſent in its true and genuin collours, but twines and twiſts like a crooked Serpent, to faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſome reproach upon innocent men. Can there be a more certain Stepend then the <hi>free benevolence of true Chriſtians</hi> to a <hi>true Chriſtian Miniſter;</hi> Or do any of our Miniſters complain of wanr, or come to begg of the <hi>Presbyterians?</hi> but he ſhould have ſaid we were againſt a forced man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance by <hi>Horning, poinding, Impriſonment,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102472:81"/>
Adjudication of Lands,</hi> by which tools ye exact <hi>Temporals</hi> from ſuch as will have none of theſe things ye call <hi>Spirituals:</hi> And herein we have many <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and good <hi>Proteſtants</hi> for us, as ye cannot but know; altho this degenerate and ſelf ſeeking ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration have forſaken their paths, and have followed the way of <hi>Balaam, who lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wages of unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His twelfth Inſtance is, <hi>They denyed that a Chriſtian ought to be a Magiſtrate or in any caſe make Warr, to take or adminiſter Oaths; Or trouble any man, upon the account of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Or to prohibite any kind of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are five bold accuſations again; whether they were doctrines of theſe <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> I know not, nor am I concerned: I think it is very unlike that ſuch fighters as they were ſaid to be, would deny all Warrs to be Lawful.</p>
               <p>But to the <hi>firſt</hi> I Anſwer, It is a horrid and ſhameleſs Lie; And for inſtance, ſome of us have been Magiſtrates partieularly <hi>Gavine Lawrie</hi> in the Province of <hi>Eaſt New-Jarſey</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> to the great ſatisfaction of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> Which Text they expounded thus; <hi>That all the wealth of the World belonged properlie to the Saints, and whatſoever other men poſſeſſed was but by uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Agreeable to this was the practiſe of our <hi>Presbiterians,</hi> who after they had got poſſeſſion of the <hi>Kings Revenue,</hi> the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Rents,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts Eſtates,</hi> and theſe they called <hi>Malignants,</hi> and were ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Nation with <hi>inſupportable Ceſſes</hi> and <hi>Exciſe:</hi> They at laſt deviſed a trick how the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> might robe the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> by forcing every man, who was not as Zealous as the ſervency of the times requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>To lend them his money upon the publick Faith</hi> (commonly called <hi>the Blind Bonds</hi>) which Faith certainly will never juſtifie them, <hi>For the wicked borrweth and paveth not again.</hi> Yet in all this the Judgement of GOD was viſible, for the moſt part of them who gote the ſpoil of their Native Country, leſt their Heirs in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then they might have done, if they had never meddled.</p>

               </list>
               <p>Next, we come to his third Argument, againſt <hi>Divine immediat Revelation; viz,</hi>
                  <q> If the Spirit or the Light within every Man, were the Supream and Principal Rule, then theſe who perſecuted to Death the Apoſtles and Saints of God, did not Sin in ſo doing; but I am ſure the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is falſe:</q> 
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> the former: To prove the Conſequence of the <hi>Major,</hi> he citeth <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 16. 2. alledging, <q>That Paul walked according to his Light, and that his Light taught him, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all he had for Light, he ought to do many things againſt the Profeſſors and Servants of Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Let the Reader obſerve, <hi>Firſt,</hi> His conſtant diſingenuity, whereof he hath
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102472:84"/>
been ſo often found guilty: For he ſhould have ſaid, If the Teachings of the Spirit of Chriſt and His Light, wherewith He hath enlightned every Man, be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Rule, &amp;c. Which would have urged upon Blaſphemy, if the reſt of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been added to it: Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is the true ſtate of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Obſerve how blind the Man is, for he hath fallen in the Ditch he digged for us; <hi>Paul</hi> (ſaith he) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all that he had for Light, <hi>Ought to do many things againſt the Servants of Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> had the Scriptures (and was learned in the knowledge of them) for Light: <hi>Ergo,</hi> according to our Author, <hi>Paul</hi> according to the Light of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ought to perſecute the Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By this Argument the Old World, yea all who lived before <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote, had no Sin, becauſe no Scripture, and the Light of Chriſt, and Teachings of the Spirit, was no ſufficient Rule to them: All the <hi>Mahumitans</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> at this day have no Rule, therefore no Sin. Theſe are the wild Conſequences of this Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> His inſtancing <hi>Paul</hi> is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent; For <hi>Paul</hi> had the Scriptures,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102472:84"/>
and was one of them who thought they had <hi>Eternal Life</hi> in the Scriptures, and no doubt he thought them <hi>a Rule for his perſecut<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing the Saints:</hi> For he ſaid he had lived <hi>blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly according to the Low:</hi> And therefore it could be no other thing but the Light of Chriſt, and the teachings of his Spirit, which brought <hi>Paul</hi> to a better Underſtanding. And whereas he ſaith in his next Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>That Paul never counteracted, his Light, was always of the ſame Judgement, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never had a true Light till the day of his Converſion,</hi> This clearly contradicts the Scriptures, and the experience of all Ages: <hi>John 12 Chap. 36. While ye have Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Light, that ye may be the children of the Light:</hi> Hence it is clear, Men have <hi>Light</hi> before <hi>Converſion,</hi> or becoming <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light.</hi> And again he ſaid <hi>John</hi> 3. 19. The condemnation of the World was not for want of Light, but for <hi>Loving darkneſs</hi> more then <hi>Light:</hi> Every Servant received a Talent, and it was ſaid <hi>From him that had not ſhall be taken away even that which he hath.</hi> All which intimats, that it is not want of Light, but not believing in nor taking heed to the Light that cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Men to err. And <hi>Prov: 1. 23. Turn ye at my Reproof, behold I will pouer out my
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102472:85"/>
Spirit upon you,</hi> &amp;c. 24. <hi>I have called and ye refuſed, and I have ſtretched out my hand; and no man regarded.</hi> verſe 25. <hi>Ye have ſet at naught all my Counſells and would none of my reproofs, 30 They would none of my Counſel they deſpiſed all my reproofes; therefore they ſhall eat the fruits of their own waies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is manifeſt, That CHRIST the Light the Wiſdom of GOD, calls, reproves, ſtretcheth out his hand, oflers his Councils even to ſuch as reject him, and do not regard him, and therefore are at laſt rejected by him.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, The Experiences of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſheweth that it is a Law <hi>engraven or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on the Souls of all men</hi> not to do that to another, which we would not ſhould be done to our ſelves. This the <hi>Heathens</hi> taught before <hi>Chriſt</hi> preached it; And therefore perſecution cannot be but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a ſin againſt Light, and tho <hi>Paul</hi> by the prejudice of his Education, and a blind Zeal for upholding of that Law or form of Worſhip which was to be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed did ignorantly and inconſideratly ruo on to perſccute the Saints: Yet it can no more be ſaid that he acted according to all he had for Light, then it can be ſaid that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> acted according to the Scripture in the that <hi>Murther of the Arch Biſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:102472:85"/>And tho this may ſerve to anſwer the two following Arguments. Yet what ſeems to have weight in them, I ſhall take notice of.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Fourth</hi> Argument is, <hi>Divine Light is alwayes conſonant to it ſelf.</hi> But the Light within one Man is quite contradictory and oppoſite to that within another, as the many and great Contraverſies in all ages do but too well make out.</p>
               <p>This is eaſily anſwered, and no leſs ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily retorted; For who dare deny but the Scriptures is alwayes couſonant to it ſelf; And yet how many and great are the Contraverſiies among theſe who profeſs it to be their only Rule. Was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of GOD to <hi>Saul Dubious,</hi> to deſtroy <hi>Amaleck?</hi> No, But <hi>Saul</hi> diſobeyed it. The like is the example of <hi>Jonah.</hi> Is not the Counſel of GOD alwayes conſonant to it ſelf, yet men reject it. And for his Argument from the pertinacy of <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Hereticks.</hi> I am ready to think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, when I conſider the madneſs of mine own Country men, who would rather <hi>chooſe to he hanged then pray for their Lavvful King,</hi> in obedience to a plaine Scriptute precept.</p>
               <p>All the Conntraverſies in the World, as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102472:86"/>
well as all the Warrs are the product of mens luſts, and neither is the Scripture nor the Light culpable, but carnal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds of Men; Eſpecially the Clergy: (See 1 <hi>Corinth:</hi> 3. and 3.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Fifth</hi> Argument is a ſingular one, The ſubſtance whereof is, <hi>There are many in the World</hi> (whereof I am one ſayes he) <hi>who by all the Light they have attained to, and after an impartial ſearch, firmlie believe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as one thought from the Light with; in to the contrarie, that Quakeriſm is the path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to utter deſtruction: It muſt therefore be ſo, if the Doctrine that every man muſt follow his Light, be true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Argument is ſufficiently Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, only his Inſtance of himſelf is ſtrange, I would therefore ask him wil, lingly, Had he never any check for all the Lies, Slanders, Perverſions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Inſinuations publiſhed in his Book? If he ſay nay, I muſt ſay, Certainly the man is in a very deſperate condition, and to be pittyed: But I doubt not the day ſhall come in which the <hi>Light,</hi> now by him ſo much deſpyſed, will ſpeak to him in a Language that ſhall not be very pleaſing to him, and which all his deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Quibles cannot ſilence, I wiſh it may
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102472:86"/>
be in Merey. His <hi>Ipſe dixi</hi> hath no force with me, He firmly believes, <hi>That all the other Profeſſions of Chriſtianity except his own, are the path way to utter deſtruction:</hi> It is therefore true? Becauſe, <hi>dumb idol Shep berd</hi> hath ſaid ſo, whoſe right Eye is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly darkned, and whoſe right Hand is clean dryed up: If the light in him be darknes how great is that darkneſs?</p>
               <p>His <hi>Sixth</hi> Argument is, <hi>If GOD ſuffered the moſt part of men in the time of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to walk in their own wayes, then all and every one bath not ſufficient Grace and Light, whereby they may come to Salvation;</hi> But the former Is true. <hi>Ergo</hi> the latter for proof of his <hi>Minor,</hi> he citeth <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 16. And telleth us that the Evidence of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſtrangly ſtraitneth <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it doth not ſtraiten ns, for we know that the Spirit of the LORD ſtrove with the Old World, &amp; he <hi>Called</hi> and they <hi>refuſed.</hi> He <hi>Gave his Counſel,</hi> but they <hi>rejected</hi> it; therefore he ſuffered them to walk in their own wayes, <hi>Rom: 1. 10. For the wrath of GOD is rovealed from Heaven againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men,</hi> &amp;c: 19. <hi>Becauſe that which may be known of GOD is manifeſt in them, for GOD hath ſhewed it unte them.</hi> And verſe 21. <hi>Becauſe when they
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102472:87"/>

               <p>Next he ſaith, <hi>The knowledge of ſome things are abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation; But all men have not this knowledge; therefore all men have not ſufficient light to guide them unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a meer <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to ſay, ſome men ſhut their eyes and will not ſee: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Sunſhineth not. I have told him before that the World is not condemned for <hi>want of light,</hi> but for <hi>loving darkneſs,</hi> and I acknowledge where the Scriptures are to be had; The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them is indiſpenſibly neceſſary, but where that cannot be had, I ſay with Doctor <hi>Barron,</hi> GOD could of old, yea can at this day gather and defend his Church without Scripture: And I think our Author dar not ſay that the Spirit of Chriſt which taught the Apoſtles to write Scripture, cannot teach <hi>men now all things neceſſary to Salvation:</hi> Or if he ſay, that he hath limited himſelf, that he will not; I ſhall expect his proof of it by the next, for I believe no ſuch thing as yet.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Ninthly</hi> is no argument, but a new warr undertaken againſt the <hi>Light of Chriſt;</hi> He begins with his uſual <hi>forth,</hi> ſaying,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102472:90"/>
will overthrow another principil of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> upon which the whole fabrick of <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> is builded; He had ſaid in his firſt argument, that the whole fabrick of <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> was overthrown: This then muſt be ſuperfluous, but the man forgets himſelf ſometimes and muſt be pardoned.</p>
               <p>He begins according to his cuſtom with three groſs lies; Iſt, that we aſlert that man in his <hi>fallen eſtate</hi> cannot do any thing that is as to the ſubſtance of the action good, for an unregenerate man may, plow which is good as to the ſubſtance of the action, and yet the <hi>Plowing of the wicked is ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He accuſeth us as <hi>Socinians,</hi> whereas he himſelf is the <hi>Soeinian,</hi> in that he acknowledgeth that fallen man by nature can know that <hi>there is a GOD who is to be Loved, Feared,</hi> and <hi>Adored;</hi> page 99. And <hi>that we ought to do unto another as we would he ſhould do unto us,</hi> page 110. This is to ſay, nature fallen and corrupted can <hi>teach us to love GOD, and and our Neighbour</hi> which is the <hi>ſumm of the Law, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> againſt which <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine <hi>R: B:</hi> hath beſtowed more then a whole page of his apologie</p>
               <p>His <hi>Third</hi> lie is, <hi>that the whole World perceiveth clearly, that there is no light common
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102472:91"/>
to all mankind, except ſome ſmall Relicts of that once bright ſhinning of GOD, like the dim ſparkles of an extinguiſhed Lantron; And herein lyes the ſtreſs of the contraverſie.</hi> We on the other hand aſſert, that when man had by his fall brought himſelf and his poſterity into a miſerable condition, GOD had mercy on him, and entered into a new Covenant with him, in the <hi>ſeed of the Woman, CHRIST JESUS:</hi> Upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter terms then the <hi>former Covenant,</hi> and that Chriſt the <hi>Light</hi> did of New Enlighten him, or to uſe his own words; Light the Candle of that extinguiſhed Lantron, whereby he might ſee and know the things of GGD, and be ſaved from out of that miſerable eſtate whereinto he had brought himſelf his fall, and that this is moſt conſonant to Scripture and ſound reaſon, will appear by the <hi>Sequal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, The Covenant of works</hi> was made with <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity, and the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace</hi> was made with man in his fallen eſtate, and confirmed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and all the Law, and ratified by by the <hi>Death of Chriſt</hi> under the Goſpel. Now the queſtion here is, whether the Covenant of Grace left man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the ſame condition it found him;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102472:91"/>
That is to the dim ſparkles of an extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Lantron, which (our Author ſaith) are never able to ſhew the wandering tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veler in the dark night his way home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or whether Chriſt the Mediator of this <hi>Covenant the Light,</hi> which enlightneth every man coming into the World, did give unto man light and grace ſufficient for fullfilling the Terms of this <hi>New Covenant?</hi> For to deny, this were to impeach the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of GOD: For the <hi>Adam</hi> had ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Light, Grace, and Power, to fulfill the <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> I hope our Author will not deny; And to aſſert, that his Poſterity had not Light nor Grace ſufficient to fulfill the Terms of the <hi>Second Covenant,</hi> were no leſs then to ſay, that men were nothing bettered by the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> but were left to ſeek their way with their extinguiſhed Lanthron; And that the Old World was drowned, and they damned for want of Light, or Knowledge of the Will of GOD, which is abſurd as well as contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: For the Spirit of GOD ſtrove with them, and told <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>in,</hi> that if he did well, he ſhould be accepted, and if he did evil, ſin lay at the door; Which ſaying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth that <hi>Cain</hi> knew the God and the evil. Did not Chriſt preach to the Old
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102472:92"/>
World in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> I Pet: 3. 19. And if this be true, that fallen man had no Law nor Light, but an extinguiſhed Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, by what Law could the men of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> be condemned? I know nothing he can ſay to this, but that <hi>direful Doctrine of Reprobation,</hi> which yet will not ſerve his turn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> That this Light wherewith Chriſt hath enlightned every man, is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural &amp; ſufficient, is ſo largely proved by <hi>Samuel Fiſher, William Penn, George Keith,</hi> and <hi>Ro: Barkclay,</hi> and all the Objections anſwered, is nottour to any who hath been at pains to read their Writings, ſo that it might ſuffice to direct my Reader thereto; Yet ſhall I take notice of what ſeems to have any weight.</p>
               <p>In the firſt he comes above board, and calls it <hi>Reaſon;</hi> 
                  <q>And then (for I wave his railing and reflections) Reaſon is Natural, and Man is Rational, That Man excriſing his Reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the Works of Creation and Providence, cannot but conclude that they are the Product of an <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent Creator,</hi> who is to be <hi>Loved, Feared,</hi> and <hi>adored,</hi> which thoughts as to the ſubſtance of the Action are
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102472:92"/>
certainly good.</q> And what ſaith all thi to the purpoſe? Are not the prayers and plowing of the wicked as good as the ſubſtance of the Action, and yet ſin?</p>
               <p>But the Queſtion is, Whether man had no other Principle in him, whereby he could diſcern theſe things, but his natural and corrupt Reaſon, which was the thing incumbent upon him to prove, and which he hath wholly omitted; Seeing the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The natural man cannot diſcern the Things of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Second</hi> Argument is, Whatever is in man, and common to all Mankind is Natural, but ſome ſparks of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a <hi>Deitie,</hi> and ſome good Thoughts as the deſire of ſelf-preſervation are in man, &amp; common to all Mankind: <hi>Ergo,</hi> c&amp;.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major is falſe,</hi> otherwayes it would follow, <hi>That the Grace of GOD which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Salvation</hi> (which is in Man) <hi>and hath appeared to all Men,</hi> muſt be <hi>Natural,</hi> and the <hi>Life of Chriſt, the Light of Men</hi> muſt be <hi>Natural,</hi> both which are abſurd.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Third</hi> is much to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>That which is originally born with every Man, and up to more and more maturity.</hi> is undoubtedly natural, <hi>but ſome remainders of the Knowledge of God are originally, that is in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102472:93"/>
the Principle or Inclination, born with Man, and grows up to more and more maturity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the growth of him in whom they are, Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> They are Natural.</p>
               <p>Certainly if this Argument hold, &amp; Man that lives long and grows up to a great hight, muſt acquire a great Knowledge of God, which is ridiculous: And <hi>Seneea</hi> had more Knowledge than this Author, as before cited, who ſaid, There were <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Seeds ſown in Man, which grew according to the entertainment they melt with:</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this of <hi>Seneea</hi> be more conſonant to our Saviour's Parable of the <hi>Sower</hi> and the <hi>Seed,</hi> than our Author's Argument, let the Reader judge. The Seed was ſown by Chriſt in all Grounds; the Seed gtew. <hi>Ergo</hi> (according to our Author) it was <hi>Natural;</hi> And the Talents were given to the profitable and unprofitable Servants, and they grew as they were improved; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they were <hi>Natural.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Fourth</hi> Argument is, <hi>That which is common to Devils, is not ſupernatural; But to know and believe that there is a God, which is of it ſelf a good thought, is common to Devils, Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>When our Author gives us a learned Treatiſe of <hi>Nature of Angels,</hi> of their
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102472:93"/>
                  <hi>Fall,</hi> and what they <hi>Loſt,</hi> and what they <hi>Retained;</hi> And tells us whence he learned it, and then proves, that Men and the Devils in their nature, in their Fall and ſince their Fall, are in all things alike, he may have an Anſwer: For my part, I ſeek not to be wiſe above what is revealed; I know that Men and Angels Fell, and that Man was <hi>Redeemed by Chriſt,</hi> and not Devils; And that he purchaſed for Man Grace, whereby he might attain to <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>New Ohedience;</hi> which are the Terms of the <hi>Second Covenant.</hi> I know alſo the Devils believe that there is a God, and that this their belief of His immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Juſtice, is no ſmall patt of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as well as future Torment; where by they know that they ſhall be eternally tormented in Hell. And if ever our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor come there, (which God forbid) he will find this to be a part of his Nature, as he would inſinuate in his next Argument, where he ſaith, <hi>That which will accompany the Wicked to Hell, cannot be called Grace, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, or any thing ſupernatural:</hi> He ſhould have ſaid, that which <hi>ſuffereth in Hell:</hi> For certainly all that is natural to Man muſt ſuffer in Hell, but that which cauſeth
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102472:94"/>
Man to ſuffer in Hell can be no part of his Nature: Hence <hi>Cauſin</hi> in his <hi>Holy Court Tom. 3. Pag. 433.</hi> 
                  <q>The Darkneſs of Hell is apprehended as moſt intollerable Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il, and that with juſt cauſe: Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I affirm the greareſt Torment of the Damned, and hight of their notable Calamities, is Light, I ſay, Light of Science and Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Sixth</hi> Argument is, <q>That Men have naturally ſome Relicks of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, and can do ſome things contained in the Law of God, we muſt firmly conclude from that expreſs Text, <hi>Rom. 2. 14. The Gentiles who have not the Law, do by Nature the things contained in the Law.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He proceeds upon his former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Inſinuations, as if we denied that fallen Man, or Man in the Fall could do any Action good, as to the ſubſtance, (as he ſaith now) he can do ſome things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law of God; whereas the Devil could confeſs Chriſt before Men, as in <hi>Luke 4. 34.

               </p>
               <p>This is a meer Quibble: For the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, Whether Man by <hi>Nature</hi> as <hi>Fallen</hi> and <hi>corrupted,</hi> can do any thing that is
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102472:94"/>
acceptable to God? which he ſhould have proven, or elſe been ſilent. And as to that Scripture he citeth, it maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for, but againſt him: For clearing of which, I ſhall ask him this Queſtion-Whether the Actions done by theſe <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> (who not having the Law, did by <hi>Nature</hi> the things contained in the Law, which ſhew the work of the Law written in their Hearts) were acceptable to God, or not? If he ſay, not: He contradicts the Apoſtle, <hi>Verſ. 26. Therefore if <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion keep the Righteouſneſs of the Law, ſhall not his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumſion he counted for Circumciſion?</hi> And Verſ. 27. <hi>And ſhall not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion which is by nature, if it fulfil the Law, judge thee who by the Letter and Circumeiſion, doſt tranſgreſs the Law?</hi> And <hi>Act. 10. 34, 35. Of a truth I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every Nation, he that fearth him, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted of him,</hi> If he ſay, theſe Actions done by the ſtrength of fallen and corrupted Nature were acceptable to God; then it follows, that Man by Nature in the Fall, can pleaſe God, and ſo have no need of a S viour. I ſhall here add a Saying of <hi>J. Humfrey,</hi> with the Approbation foreſaid of <hi>R. Baxter,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Redemption, Pag.</hi> 29.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102472:95"/>
30. <q>It is agreeable to that Righteouſneſs of God, which is revealed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and to common Reaſon, that when Chriſt died to Redeem the World from the Law of Works, becauſe through the weakneſs of the Fleſh, it was impoſſible for us to perform the ſame; The new Terms which he hath procured for us in the remedying Law, ſhould be ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted to our fallen Eſtate, as to be made no leſs poſſible for us, or within our power now, than the Covenant of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was to <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. There is no Interpretation of Scripture muſt be admitted againſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Reaſon and the Goodneſs of God. Now to ſay, that the Juſt and Merciful GOD would require fallen Man to walk without Light, to act without Power, is contrary to the Goodneſs of GOD and univerſal Reaſon, and to the Tenor of the new and remedving Covenant.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In page 104, He ſaith, <hi>Men by nature have the knowledge of Politicks and the prudent management of Worldly affairs; Therefore men may be ſaid to have the Law writen in their Hearts without a New Govenant diſpenſation; Becauſe the ſecond table of the Law which is a Rule for Politicks, is the Law of GOD as well as the firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:102472:95"/>This can import nothing leſs then this, That becauſe he had natural and corrupt reaſon, he had nothing more; Or that he that hath his ſenſes hath not Reaſon: For <hi>Nimrod</hi> had Politicks and ſo had <hi>Moſes,</hi> but <hi>Nimrod</hi> had not ſuch a foundation for his <hi>Politicks;</hi> And why? Becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> Government was a <hi>Theoeracie; Nimrods</hi> an humane Monarchy; And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> needed the immediat Teachings of GOD for his Politicks; <hi>Nimrod</hi> only Reaſon; Tho he had more, if he had regarded it. And yet the ſecond Table of the Law is more like <hi>Penal Statutes</hi> then <hi>Politick Laws.</hi> And whereas he ſaith, That <hi>Jo: Brown</hi> hath proven by many demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the writing of the Law in the Heart cannot at all be taken in this place, for any part of the New Covenant; He might have been ſo kind to his Reader, as to have given one of theſe many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, before he had ſo railed at and gloryed over his Adverſary: Eſpecially, conſidering that <hi>John Browns</hi> Books are ſo rare to be ſeen, and ſeldom or never objected to us by any man of ſenſe.</p>
               <p>His next is in anſwer to R: B's: ſaying, If <hi>Romans</hi> 2. 14. Be underſtood of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, It would contradict that of

               </p>
               <p>To which he Replyes, That Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> as he calls him, hath utterly denyed this contradiction to follow upon their expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this place; But hath neither given us the Expoſition, nor the Harmony of the places; This might paſs in the Pulpit, but it is ſhameful in Print, he had better waved it as he hath done many more: But if the Reader will be at the pains to look <hi>Beza's</hi> Notes, he will find that he expreſly ſaith on 1 <hi>Cor: 2. 14.

And what <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith upon 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2. 14.

                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:102472:96"/>In page 105. After a citation of R: B's words concerning the <hi>fall of man,</hi> he ſaith, <q>It willl be counted a compleat Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to ſay, that fallen man hath no Relicts of the Image of GOD, and yet hath a Seed of Righteouſneſs, ſeeing that Righteouſneſs is one of the chief parts of the Image of GOD.</q> But wherein lyeth the Contradiction here? In ſaying, he who hath the Seed, hath not the Fruit? Or in ſaying, that the Seed tho ſown in all kinds of Grounds, needs an influence from Heaven before it can bring forth Fruit? And (to uſe his own ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude) till the Candle of his extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrd Lanthorn be of new lighted again, it can do us no good, nor affoord us any Light but ſmoak and ſtink: But the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities are his own in contradicting the <hi>Weſtminſter Catechiſm;</hi> Which to the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>What is original ſin?</hi> Anſwereth, <hi>It is the want of Original Righteouſneſs, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our whole nature,</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>After this being conſcious to himſelf, he hath ſaid nothing to purpoſe, he fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth to the covers of deceit, and refuge of Lies; Saying, <q>There is a Myſtery latent under this Doctrine, which we muſt here diſcover; The <hi>Quakers</hi> have no other Chriſt then this that was left in <hi>Adam,</hi> and remaineth in man in his fallen condition, to which they give many great Names, as Light, Life, meaſure of GOD, GOD Himſelf, and moſt frequently the Seed.</q> Then he citeth ſome broken Paſſages out of Books, which whether true or falſe I am indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; For they are chiefly out of two Books of <hi>George Keiths</hi> yet unanſwered; And if our Author pleaſe to enter the liſts with him, I ſhall be willing to be a Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator; Till then it is curriſh manners to ſnarle at his heels, while he dare not ſet his face to it.

               <p>Next he calls it Blaſphemy to ſay, <hi>That the ſeed needs a new Viſitation to raiſe it up:</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:102472:98"/>

               <p>In page 108, To clear his Brother <hi>John Brown</hi> of the abſurdity of aſletting that the <hi>Devils and all unregenerate men are in a certain reſpect Spiritual, and the Apoſtle and all Regenerate men are in a certain reſpect car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi> He giveth us a very ready ſolution of it thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whatever is a Spirit may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Spiritual, and whatever is a body may be called Corporal, and ſo the Devil is a ſpirit, and unregenerate men have ſouls: Therefore they are ſpiritual, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had fleſh, therefore he was Carnal. To prove this futher, he ſaith <hi>John Brown</hi> hath given 15 <hi>arguments;</hi> Whereof our Author could not beſtow one upon us, but if they be no better then the laſt we got he hath done well to be frugall of his paper, and think it enough to vaper a little, and tell us all theſe are but <hi>fictions, hobgoblins</hi> fit only to fright children.</p>
               <p>His ſeventh argument is, <q>If fallen man retain no knowledge of GOD, no principles of common honeſty &amp; mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, then there is no difference betwixt a Man and a bruit, neither can it be told in what the Wiſdom of the wiſe <hi>Gentiles</hi>

                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> this argument ſerveth only to make a muſter, the ſubſtance whereof hath been handled before, for it is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the falſe ſuppoſition that Mankind received no benefite by the <hi>ſecond Covenant,</hi> but was left in that miſerable condition brought upon him by the fall, which is contrary to the ſcope of the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and our Author hath been ſo wary as to contradict it himſelf in his very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; Saying, who not withſtanding could not perceive the things of GOD, until they were again revealed, whereas he hath ſaid before, <hi>That man by nature could know and underſtand the firſt and ſecond Table of the Law; Yea know GOD to be Infinite, Omnipotent, and that he ſhould be loved, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Adored, and that we ſhould love our Neighbour as our ſelf,</hi> which is nothing more then to do to others as we would be done by; What need then of a <hi>new Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> ſeeing this is the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. He citeth 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2. In all which
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:102472:99"/>
Chapter I can find nothing but what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts him to his Teeth, and <hi>Beza's</hi> note at the end of it is, <hi>We are indued with the Spirit of Chriſt, who openeth unto us theſe ſecrets which by all other means are unſearchable. (Mark</hi>) and alſo all truth whatſoever. Now if all Truth whatſoever be unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able without the Spirit of Chriſt, as <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith they are, what is become of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors dark Lantern, whereby, as by the light of corrupt nature he will have men to know that great truth, the foundation of all Truth, <hi>Viz.</hi> That there is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent GOD, who is to be Loved, Feared and Adored.</hi> Add to this, That no man <hi>knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son ſhall Reveal him;</hi> And then let the Reader conſider whether <hi>Beza</hi> and the Scriptures are better to be believed then our Author his dark Lantern. As to the Wiſdom of the Wiſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> there is a Wiſdom whereby GOD is known; and a Wiſdom whereby GOD is not known; So ſaith the Scripture, The <hi>World through Wiſdom knew not GOD,</hi> and that ſome men were bruitiſh in their knowledge, and as <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, what they knew naturally as bruit in theſe things, they corrupt themſelves; This is
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:102472:99"/>
Mans natural Wiſdom: But <hi>Job</hi> who was one of the wiſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> tells us that the <hi>Inſpiration of the Almighty giveth underſtanding: Ariſtotle</hi> alſo, Another of the wiſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> tells us in his <hi>Ethicks Lib:</hi> 10, Chap: 4. 7. <hi>They that did theſe things did them not as men, but as having ſomething Divine, or of GOD in them;</hi> And <hi>Dindvmus</hi> ſaid to <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great: If thou wilt hearken to my words, thou ſhalt poſseſs of my goods, who have GOD to my friend, and whoſe inſpiration I injoy within me.</hi> I have inſtanced <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to him already, next let him hear <hi>Plato,</hi> whom he alſo nameth; <hi>Phaed: The Light and Spirit of GOD,</hi> ſaith he, are as <hi>Wings to the Soul,</hi> or as that which raiſeth up the Soul into a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Communion with GOD</hi> above the World, which the mind of man is ready to be mire it ſelf with.</p>
               <p>It could add many more, but theſe may ſuffice to ſhew, that the wiſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> derived their Knowledge of GOD from an higher principle then our Authors dark Lantern; I ſhall only add one; to wit, <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew, Leg: Alleg: Lib: 1. How ſhould the Soul of man know GOD, if he did not inſpire her, and take hold of her by his Divine Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>page</hi> 110 he ſaith the defect of the Wiſdom of the <hi>Heathens</hi> was in this,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102472:100"/>
that they could not perceive Chriſt, but he ſhould have remembred the laſt words of <hi>Plato</hi> whom he nameth, related by <hi>Marcilius Ficinus,</hi> who wrote his life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked by ſome that viſited him, <hi>how long men ſhould attend to his writings?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>till that more Holy and Divine Perſon ſhould appear to viſit the World, whom all men ought to follow;</hi> And that Elogue of <hi>Virgil</hi> (which ſeems to have at firſt crackt him) is a plain intimation of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the comming of Chriſt, and that they did not receive him when he came is not to be attributed to their want of Light, any more then the <hi>Phariſeer,</hi> who had the Law and the <hi>Prophets;</hi> For we ſee that many of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were more ready to receive the Goſpel, then theſe learned <hi>Rabbies</hi> who thought they had Eternal Life in the Scriptures. As for the difference between a Man and a bruit, it is reaſon which GOD gave for the Government, and preſervation of the outward man, for which ſee <hi>Poiret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In page 111. He tells us a Hen hath skill in Arithmetick; If this be true, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the <hi>Presbyterian hens</hi> muſt be wiſer then ours, for our women who look after the poultry, aſſure me that our Hens
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102472:100"/>
have no ſuch skill, but that a <hi>cunning man</hi> like out Author, <hi>may ſteall half her Eggs from her, and never be quarrelled.</hi> If he read <hi>Le Grands Natural Hiſtory,</hi> he may get better Inſtances; But this is rediculous.</p>
               <p>His eight Argument is from <hi>Rom: 1. 19. 20. Becauſe that which may be known of GOD, is manifeſt in them, for GOD hath ſhewed it unto them.</hi> From hence he concludes, that there is ſome Reliques of the <hi>Divine Image</hi> or <hi>Natural Knowledge</hi> left in Man: And to ſay, that the true Knowledge of GOD and Divine Things, is not <hi>Natural Man,</hi> but the Fruits of Chriſts purchaſe to Mankind, after the <hi>Fall,</hi> in and by the <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> This he calls <hi>pure Paganiſm.</hi> And to prove all this, he only cryes, <hi>Who would dare to ſay or affirm, that what was common to the</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, <hi>Yea, and Devils alſo was as really ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Fruit of Chriſts purchaſe, as that which is proper to the Godly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I verily believe, the Devils have more knowledge then he, how they came by it, I am not concerned, he may ask them when he hath occaſion; But I know none ever aſſerted it to be ſaving, except it be his Brother <hi>John Brown,</hi> when he printed his Preaching to them. But
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102472:101"/>
Mankind was not left in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>For Chriſt was preached to them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after the fall;</hi> And to deny that they received Grace, were to contradict the Scriptures, <hi>For that the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seed ſown in the ſtoney ground, and in the Good Ground was the ſame,</hi> none but <hi>a Presbyterian</hi> will deny. And <hi>that the Tallent given to the unfaithful ſervant, was as true Money as the reſt, I think all will confeſs;</hi> Or elſe how could he have been condemned for not improving it. So that if he condemn us here, he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Scriptures with us; Which alſo ſaith, <hi>That GOD wills all men to be ſaved:</hi> But here they tells us, <hi>That GOD hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will to ſave them, and yet a ſecret will to damn them.</hi> O impudent and pervetle Generation / <hi>Who dare accuſe the Righteous GOD of Truth with bypocriſie,</hi> The wiſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles whom they reject, would have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hored ſuch doctrine. Moteover, it is very abſurd to ſay from this Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. That man had the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of GOD by Nature: For <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It was manifeſt in them, not in the Creatures without them</hi> (tho that was alſo an Adminacle to help their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) <hi>but their Knowledge was inward, and all that might be known, therefore not any
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102472:101"/>
imperfect Knowledge.</hi> And Secondly, <hi>GOD hath ſhewed it unto them;</hi> That is, <hi>GOD hath manifeſted or revealed to man in himſelf that which may be known of GOD; For the words Shewed and Manifeſted, are the ſame in the Greek,</hi> and very conſonant to that other ſaying of the ſame Apoſtle; <hi>The things of GOD can no man know but by the Spirit of GOD.</hi>

               <p>In the reſt of page 112. and 113. He takes the Liberty to ſcold, raile, and lie at random; All which I paſs by except this: <hi>And yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this Natural Light is to the Quakers their God, their Chriſt, their Grace, and whatſoever elſe is neceſſary to Sal vation.</hi> To prove this, he giveth us an heap of Citations, which it ſeems he hath gathered from his Brethren <hi>Hicks</hi> and <hi>Faldo,</hi> the known Forgers. I ſhall ſhew his diſingenuity in the firſt of theſe of Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by ſetting down <hi>William Penn's</hi> words, whereby the Reader may know whoſe footſteeps our Author hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Chriſtian <hi>Quaker,</hi> page 116 If then the Life of the Word be the Light of Men, unleſs the Life of the Word he Natural, the Light of it muſt be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, Divine and Infinite, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102472:102"/>
the Life of the Word to be; And this checks the dull ignorance or baſe deceit of <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> who either could not or would not underſtand <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> when he ſaid (the Light muſt be Divine, becauſe the Life from whence it comes is ſo, and the Effect is alwayes of the ſame nature with the cauſe) in any other ſenſe then this; That becauſe (ſaith <hi>T: Hicks,</hi> GOD is the cauſe of Beaſts and Trees, therefore they are God. Which ſtrange Conſtruction of <hi>George Whitehead's</hi> words, bewtays either great ſtupidity or diſingenuity, I would ask the very angry man, Is there no effect of Power beſide that of Nature? Did the Father of T: H: beget a Beaſt or a Man when he begat him? Surely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he has abandoned all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, me thinks, he that makes in his Book ſo notable a diſtinction betwixt Reaſon and Railing, by uſing ſo little of the one, and ſo much of the other, ſhould put put one betwixt a Natural and Potential Effect, I mean ſuch an Effect as proceeds from Nature, and one that comes from meer Power. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life can naturally produce nothing
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102472:102"/>
that is not as Divine as it ſelf; But its Power had made all that is not of its ſelf, as well inanimate as animate Beeings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſet down <hi>William Penn's</hi> words at length, That the Reader may ſee, how little Conſcience theſe men make of <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing honeſt Men;</hi> And that our Author cares not to joyn with <hi>Anabaptiſts, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> (whom he accounts <hi>Hereticks</hi>) Yea, to take Hell rather then to want ſome Lie to alledge againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> wherefore I ſhall trouble you no more with his Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being fully Anſwered by others, but ſhall proceed to ſee what more he hath to ſay.</p>
               <p>In the end of page 115 he falls a railing and clamouring diſpetatly, Telling us, that by this dim light, Men have enough adoe to perceive that there is a Supream Beeing, what then is become of his late great aſſertions; That this dim light of Nature, Reaſon, Conſcience, extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lantern, <hi>&amp;c. Could teach men that there was one GOD, that he was Infinite, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to be Loved, Feared, and Adored,</hi> and <hi>to do others as they would be done by,</hi> which is the ſubſtance of the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets;</hi> This is confuſion and contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a Witneſs, yet he glories in the

               <p>In <hi>page</hi> 116, He would inſinuat, that we depreſs the light as much as formerly we had exalted it, becauſe when ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to it have erred, we ſay, their Doctrines are to be ſubjected to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, This he calls <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and at laſt worſe, <hi>Viz.</hi> A ſubjecting of Chriſt and GOD to another, as cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of deceiving and being deceived.</p>
               <p>Bur I would know from this windie man whether if he or any <hi>Presbyterian</hi> ſhould teach any Doctrine contrary to the Covenant and Confeſſion of Faith, and pretend Scripture for it, I ſay, whether he would be lyable to the Judgement of the <hi>General Aſsembly,</hi> and whether it were the mans pretences, or the Scriptures, which the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> takes upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to judge even ſo we neither take upon us to judge Chriſt, nor his Light, <hi>which can neither deceive nor be deceived;</hi> But the deceit and follv of ſuch pretenders as our Author and his Brethren who pretend to the Scriptures, and neither underſtand them, not walk according to them.</p>
               <p>In the next place, after a little of his accuſtomed froath, be ſaith, <hi>he will propoſe and enervat thoſe of their Arguments which ſeem
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:102472:103"/>
to be moſt ſtrong,</hi> &amp;c. And begins with <hi>George Keith,</hi> citing, Truth defended, <hi>page</hi> 87, but is <hi>page 85. A Divine Law in all men, is an inward immediate dictate, but there is a Divine Law in all men, ergo,</hi> &amp;c. To this he anſwereth by denying the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, which I cannot but admire, ſeeing <hi>George Keith</hi> hath ſo abundantly proven it in the ſame page, yet never noticed by our Author: But he thinks he hath guarded himſelf ſufficiently in his <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Reader,</hi> by forbidding them to touch or handle ſuch unclean things, as <hi>George Keiths</hi> books; But all this deceit will not cover him, for <hi>George Keith</hi> tells him, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that he hath proven this by many arguments in his book of <hi>Immediat Revelation. Secondly</hi> the <hi>Americans</hi> (whom his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary names) tranſgreſs the Divine Law, therefore they have a Divine Law: For where there is no Law there is no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. And thirdly, he cited Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> ſaying, <hi>the Law in the hearts of all men, is as really the word of GOD as that Printed in our Bibles;</hi> But <hi>Patroclus</hi> reads not this, and therefore makes ſhort work with it, and glories as if he had Vanquiſhed <hi>Euforbis,</hi> by whoſe Dart <hi>Patroclus</hi> fell.</p>
               <p>The next he attempts is <hi>R: B's:</hi> Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:102472:104"/>
                  <hi>page</hi> 39; But this is no Argument as he would falſly inſinuate, but written to ſtop the Mouth of a windy man, <hi>J: Brown,</hi> charging him with Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>But he proceeds page 118. <hi>That which we ſin in not obeying is ſufficient to Salvation, but in not obeying the Light within, we ſin; Therefore it is ſufficient to Salvation. Anſwer, Firſt,</hi> he hath neither told us where, not by whom this Argument is uſed, and may be his own for any thing I know; But <hi>Secondly,</hi> he ſeems to confeſs that they ſin who do not obey the Light; And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> his anſwer is very nonſenſical, to wit, it is ſin to diſobey the Lawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Parents, which commands are not ſufficient to Salvation; But what made that diſobedience to Parents to be ſin; If the Law of GOD had not commanded obedience to them? Every ſin is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law of GOD, and therefore every ſin preſuppoſeth a Divine Law, and here I muſt tell him that his brother the author of <hi>Melius Inquirendum</hi> tells him page 303. <q>All that conſcience dictats as a Counlelour, all that Conſcience deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines as a judge, is in the name of the Supream and Soveraion <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> adding there is one Lawgiyer who is able
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:102472:104"/>
to Save and to deſtroy, and a little after Conſcience hath in its Commiſſion to dictate before the fact, as well as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the fact, it teaches what we ought to do as well as examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have done well or not,</q> By theſe it appears this man was of the mind, that that there was a Divine Law in all men, call it by what name he will.</p>
               <p>Next he comes to <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. That was the true light, which enlighteneth every man coming into the World, where he giveth two gloſſes of it; <hi>J; Browns, Firſt,</hi> that <hi>Light may be taken for the Light of</hi> reaſon; This is nonſence, as if man could be a man without reaſon; It is every man not every bruit he enlightneth, and till we underſtand more, we believe it is reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on makes the difference, ſo the gloſs muſt run thus, he enlighteneth every reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature with the light of Reaſon, The <hi>Second</hi> gloſs is, that by every man, is not to be underſtood every individual, but only every one which ſavingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened; Upon this <hi>R: B:</hi> ſaith he is puzled with this Scripture, for he knoweth not what way to take it, Whereupon our airy Author inſults, ſaying, <hi>He inferrs penurie from abundance;</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:102472:105"/>
But, ſayes he, <hi>I remembred they were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Logick;</hi> But leſs ſtoath might have ſufficed; For I am ſure, if he had not been puzled he would never have given two ſuch contrary Expoſicions, The firſt making the Light <hi>meerly natural,</hi> yet <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.</hi> The ſecond Gloſs, making it <hi>ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> but <hi>ſpecial</hi> and not <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal;</hi> Which evidently ſhews that <hi>Jo: Brown</hi> and our Author who would defend him are both in <hi>Babel.</hi> And therefore it being a matter of Conſequence to know, whether the Life of Chriſt which is the Light of Men, the Light where with every Man is inlightned be Natural or Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Univerſal or Special, Saving or Damning; It concerns our Advetlary to conſult the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> which of the two Gloſſes may be beſt to hold by, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both cannot ſtand. In the reſt of this page he doth nothing but undervalue his Adverſary, whether Juſtly let the Reader Judge.</p>
               <p>His next Combat is with <hi>John 1. 5. The darkneſs comprehended it:</hi> He ſaith, <hi>That by darkneſs is meant mon in his natural Eſtate, in which Eſtate he can comprehend what is Natural:</hi> Whence he inferis that man in this eſtate is void of all Spiritual and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102472:105"/>
Supernatural Light, Which Inference is void of all Senſe and Reaſon, for the very words before it are, <hi>The Lightſined in the darkneſs.</hi> That is according to our Author Man in his Natural Eſtate, who could comprehend natural things, but could not comprehend the Light; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (according to our Author his own <hi>Confeſſion</hi>) The Light muſt be <hi>Supernatural,</hi> or elſe the <hi>darkneſs</hi> would have comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it. After a little vapour he ſaith, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho the Light Chriſt be ſupernatural, yet the little Beams and Sparks of Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are Natural.</hi> But who ever denyed this? The thing he was to proove as well as aſſert; Was, <hi>That the Life of Chriſt which is the Light of Men, and the Light which Men are commanded to believe in, is Natural:</hi> Which he may either do or be ſilent for ever. Next he rails a while, and concluds with an abominable Lie, <hi>Viz:</hi> That we aſſert, <hi>That the dim and dark Light of Nature is GOD himſelf:</hi> This he hath learned from the <hi>Father of Lies the Prince of Darkneſs,</hi> and to <hi>him</hi> it will return, and he with it, except he repent.</p>
               <p>The next Argument he deals with, is R: B's page 19. 20. of his <hi>Vindication;</hi> I ſhall intreat the Reader to look the place,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:102472:106"/>
and compare it with our Authors bungling upon it; R: B: proveth by <hi>Rom:</hi> 8. 9. 14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. <hi>John</hi> 6. 45. <hi>John</hi> 14. 16. 17. That the Promiſes of the Spirit to teach, lead and guide, were common to all Believers and not particular to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: To which our Author replys, he ſhould have given ſome other thing for proof then bare Aſſertions; For ſo he calls all the Scripture proofs he hath brought, but meddles not with one word of them: But our Adverſary will not ſerve us ſo, he will give us Queſtions for all, and ask us, Why may not <hi>Immediat Objective Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> be promiſed to the Apoſtles in theſe places, and yet not to all Believers? <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> Becauſe GOD had promiſed before to <hi>pour out his Spirit upon all fleſh;</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> tells us after, <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> As for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he cites, they nothing touch us, for we never denyed the uſe of Means in the leadings of the ſame Spirit, as R: B: hath ſhewn at large in the place laſt cited.</p>
               <p>But in ſtead of a ſolid Anſwer to R: B's Argument, he boldly beggs the Queſtion; Saying, <hi>Whatever the Qnakers ſay we cannot help it;</hi> Certain it is, that no man of ſound Judgement will deny, that when one reads
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102472:106"/>
the Scriptures, and hath his mind Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the Spirit; he hath that promiſe fulfilled to him of which we now ſpeak. Very well <hi>Patroclus,</hi> This is more like a a <hi>Pope</hi> then a <hi>Prevbyter;</hi> But the man hath told us he cannot help it.</p>
               <p>The next Argument he aſſaults, R: B's Apologie page 38. <hi>That which all Profeſſors of Chriſtianity of whatſoever kind, are forced ultimatly to recurr unto, when preſſed to the laſt; That for becauſe of which all other foundations are recommended and accounted worthy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and without which they are granted to be of no weight at all, muſt needs be the only, moſt true, certain, and unmoveable foundation of all Chriſtian Faith; But Inward, Immedist Objective Revelation by the Spirit, is That,</hi> &amp;c: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this he offers two Anſwers: The firſt by a <hi>Simile</hi> thus, <hi>A man juſt now poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a peece of Land formerly enjoyed by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, by vertue of a Right granted to them by a Prince deceaſed many ages ago, ſpake mouth to mouth with that Prince dead ages out of mind; Thus that into which the preſent Poſseſſor of ſuch peece of Land, when preſſed to the laſt recurreth unto, and for which other Grounds or Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are comended or valide; Muſt of neceſſity be the moſt immoveable ground of and warrand for
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102472:107"/>
ſuch a peece of Land his poſſeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ion of it: But the Grant or Donation of ſuch or ſuch a Prince given many ages ago.</hi> Firſt, <hi>By word of mouth, tho again committed to writtings; Is that which the preſent Poſſeſſer being preſſed to the laſt, recurreth to. Ergo,</hi> The preſent Poſſeſſor had diſcourſe immediate <hi>mouth</hi> to <hi>mouth</hi> with a Prince in many ages back e're the <hi>preſent</hi> P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſeſſor was born.</p>
               <p>This he, And then as if he had done ſome notable feat he falls a roaring, inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mocking his adverſary, ſaying, <hi>Theſe muſt be admirable fellows,</hi> &amp;c. Their ſtrongeſt argument ſerve only to prove the Authors to be in a <hi>Paroxiſm</hi> of folly, mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing langhter in a very <hi>Heraclitus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it ſeems our Author hath been in a <hi>Paroxiſm</hi> of <hi>madneſs</hi> and <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> for his Simile can conclude nothing leſs then this, <hi>Viz. That Chriſt is dead, the Spirit of Chriſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> dead, ages out of mind,</hi> that no man <hi>heareth his voice now, nor can recur to him to be ſatisfied of his doubts,</hi> that <hi>he hath brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en all his promiſes to his Church, of being with them to the end of the World, of ſending the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter to teach them and lead them into all truth, and that great promiſe he that is with you ſhall be in you;</hi> Many more are the promiſſes in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> as in <hi>Jeremiah, Joel,</hi> and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102472:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that in <hi>Iſaiah 54. 13. All thy Children ſhall be taught of the LORD,</hi> Teſtified unto, as fulfilled in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 20, 27. If the <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Printing</hi> ſuch groſs blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as theſe, which naturally, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably flow from this ſimile, be fit to move laughter, and not rather terror and aſtoniſhment in the Author, let the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here add two Arguments fit for this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, Chriſts Sheep hear his voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Presbyterian Clergy</hi> hear not his voice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> They are not of his Sheep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Where there <hi>is no Viſion, there the people periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But among the <hi>Presbyterian Clergie,</hi> there is no viſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Their people periſh.</p>
               <p>But bleſſed be the LORD we know and believe according to the Scriptures, That <hi>Chriſt our Prince</hi> is dead ages out of mind, but liveth and Reigneth for ever, and that he is Faithful and True, and that he is alwayes preſent with his Church, that he ſtandeth at the door of their heart and knocketh; if any open to him, he entereth; and that he dwelleth in them and walketh in them, and is to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102472:108"/>
them a GOD, and they to him a people, and that if any be otherwayes minded he will even reveal this alſo unto them <hi>Phil:</hi> 3. 15. So let our Author glory in his Chartor, which we have as well as he, but be warr to <hi>blaſphem</hi> the Spirit of Chriſt, leſt the end thereof be no laughter, but weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Second anſwer</hi> is, By diſtinguiſhing <hi>immediate objective Revelation,</hi> granting it was <hi>Immediate</hi> and <hi>ohjective</hi> in reſpect of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Prophets, but not in reſpect of the preſent proſeſſors of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer, Firſt,</hi> he here maketh the ground and foundation of<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See his page</hi> 33.</note> the <hi>Faith</hi> of the prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles one thing, and that of the preſent profeſſors of Chriſtianity another thing which is abſurd. <hi>Secondly</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all Chriſtians from <hi>Immediat Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Revelation,</hi> except Prophets and Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>lation</hi> was ſo to the Prophers and Apoſtles (as he granteth) it muſt alſo be the ſame to the preſent profeſſors of Chriſtianity, and this ſhall ſuffice for his <hi>Membrum negatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>page</hi> 124. He falls upon the laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he deals with calling it the chief of his <hi>Apoſtolik Arguments</hi> (tho I find no ſuch argument in all <hi>R: B</hi>'s apologie, which he ſetteth down thus; <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham,</hi> and ſome others, had <hi>Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate objective Revelation,</hi> therefore the whole Church had it. He and his Brother <hi>John Brown</hi> deny the conſequence, but hath he not hereby cut his own throat, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to Tradition, as the Rule of that Church ſaith, for ſure they had no Scripture, and therefore had no other foundation for their Faith, nor Rule for their life but Tradition; And ſo having pleaded before, that what was their Rule muſt be ours, he muſt confeſs that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of Scripture and <hi>Revelation,</hi> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains nothing for them but <hi>Tradition,</hi> which muſt continue to be our Rule alſo; For this the <hi>Papiſts owe him thanks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little after, he confeſſes there was more of GOD in theſe dark times of the Old World, then there is now, <hi>Viz.</hi> In reſpect of <hi>Immediate Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:102472:109"/>But I would know the Reaſon of this, Seeing the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are greater, even to <hi>pour out his Spirit upon all fleſh;</hi> Is his hand ſhortned or his Ear heavie? Or is he dead, (as our Author inſinuats) or hath he leſt off to care for his Church? No, But our iniquities have ſeparated him from us, and our unbelief.</p>
               <p>But to do his Buſineſs fully, he adds, <hi>How</hi> will the prove that ever <hi>Abel</hi> had <hi>Immediat Objective Revelations? I Anſwer,</hi> GOD hath alwayes communicated as much of himſelf to the Righteous as to the wicked, but wicked <hi>Crin</hi> had <hi>Immediat Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Revelations, Ergo,</hi> Righteous <hi>Abell</hi> had them.</p>
               <p>Then he tells us that the third, fourth, and fifth Propoſiſion of the ſecond <hi>Theſe</hi> falls to the ground; But upon what ground he ſaith ſo, let the candid Reader Judge.</p>
               <p>He concluds this Chapter with a peece of his firſt Dream of the <hi>Trojan Warr,</hi> and citing <hi>Virgil,</hi> he tells us, like the <hi>Irojan Warr,</hi> its couplings being cut, the whole Faorick of <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> tumbleth down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Ears of its Authors and Builders. It's a pitty the poor man ſhould have read this Poets and others on the Hiſtory of <hi>Irov;</hi> For the Reader may ſee how he extravages
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:102472:109"/>
upon that Subject, it hath quite ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. But he hath been a little miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken here, for <hi>Patroclus</hi> did not live to ſee the <hi>Trojan</hi> Tower fall; And if he will ſtretch the Allegory a little further, he may remember that the Poſterity of the <hi>Trojans,</hi> brought the Poſterity of the <hi>Greeks</hi> under their ſubjection, and made them Tributaries, which may happen to be the face of this Author and his Brethren. But ſure I am, this Language is more like a Gallant bowling over his Cups in a Tavern. then a lober Chriſtian writing for the ſatisfaction of a Diſſenter.</p>

EPISCOPAL <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> who eſteem E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PISCOPACIE a Right and Lawful Church Government; And after this, for ſome other pretence to have turned them out of their Livings, which is their Lives; Many of them being ſo poor, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt without them; Which they had certainly done, if their beloved Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers the Babble, had been as obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the <hi>North</hi> as they were in the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we read of a deſperat <hi>Millanoiſe,</hi> who <hi>having forced his Adverſary for fear of his Life to blaſphem and abjure GOD; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly killed him, calling it a noble revenge to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both Soul and Body at once.</hi> Let out Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor make the Application, and for bear his malicious Faſtings, and black mouth'd Calumnies for the future.</p>
               <p>Moreover the groſs Doctrines of <hi>Pelagius</hi> were, <hi>Firſt, That man had no loſs by</hi> Adam, <hi>and ſo were as apt from their birth to ſerve GOD as</hi> Adam <hi>was before the Fall. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That men have no abſolute need of Grace, of Love, and the Gift of the Holy Spirit: Only it did facilitat, or make the work the eaſier, but Man by his nature could do good without Grace.</hi> Thirdly, He affirmed all the <hi>Grace</hi> was at beſt <hi>Objective,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Outward
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102472:111"/>
Preaching of the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. But he denyed any Subjective Grace, or any Grace that moved or enclined the Will immediatly unto GOD. All which we renounce, And therefore let out Author and his Brethren be for ever hereafter ſilent of that falſe and unjuſt Calumny of <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus cleared the Truth of the falſe Accuſation of <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of weight in this Chapter, but his indeavours to prove that <hi>Infants</hi> are condemned for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, upon which he acknowledgeth their Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation depends, I ſhall offer him the thoughts and arguments of ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> upon this ſubject, and then take notice of his argumentations.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> the learned <hi>Jeremy Taylour</hi> in his book called <hi>Unum neceſſarium,</hi> denyeth this <hi>Presbyterian Doctrine,</hi> and reaſon thus; Either <hi>Adam was condemned eternally, and is now ſuffering in hell for that tranſgreſſion, or he was pardoned, and is now a Glorified Saint:</hi> the firſt he ſaith, <hi>no Chriſtian will alledge Adam being a Tipe of Chriſt,</hi> and alſo <hi>that GOD entered into a new Covenant with him:</hi> So that he <hi>was not condemned for that ſin;</hi> And if the ſecond be true, that is, that <hi>he
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102472:112"/>
was pardoned,</hi> and is now a <hi>glorified Saint;</hi> How then can theſe men be ſo wickedly audacious as to charge the Infinitly Juſt and Merciful GOD with ſuch cruelty and injuſtice as the wickedeſt of men would be aſhamed of? To wit, to pardon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor (yea put him in a better conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then he was before) for his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and yet to puniſh his Poſterity (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Infants) who had no being till five Thouſand years after, who never had acceſſion, nor ſo much as a conſent to that ſin, and yet upon this wrong and wicked notion of the Deity depends their doctrine of Reprobation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is no remiſſion without repen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ance (ſaith the former Author) and alledgeth he never yet met with the man, that could ſay <hi>he had Repented for Adams ſin,</hi> and I doubt if our Author will ſay it either, for Repentance is either to be underſtood, <hi>Penitentiam agere, to do penance,</hi> or <hi>reſipiſcere,</hi> to grow <hi>wiſe again,</hi> or to <hi>do ſo no more.</hi> let our Author chuſe which of the two he will, and tell us with the next whether he hath repented for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is the Soul that ſinneth or is guilty of ſin which (according to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) we have not from <hi>Adam</hi> but from
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:102472:112"/>
GOD by new creation, who made never any thing impure, and therefore I will expect ſomething next from this learned man concerning the <hi>Soul, Quid &amp; unde,</hi> for I acknowledge they are little enough clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yet by the Learned, tho I think our Country man <hi>Barron</hi> is inferior to none I have yet ſeen; But if our author be for <hi>preexiſtance,</hi> will more eaſily give us a reaſon for our inclinations to evil.</p>
               <p>The next I ſhall cite is the ſorenamed <hi>John Humphery</hi> with <hi>R: Baxters</hi> approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who aſſerts page 26 of <hi>Eelection</hi> &amp; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> that <q>a diſcharge of mankind from damnation for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin only is a fruit of Chriſts death immediate and Univerſal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again in page 28, of the Covenant he aſſerts <q>that Infants being Baptiſed are ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, And adds if they be not Baptiſed we are yet to look on them as ſuch who have not broken this new Law, or never reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rejected their remedy and ſo long as by the <hi>Redemption</hi> of Chriſt they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered over with all the World from the Covenant of <hi>works</hi> to the <hi>New Law</hi> to be judged,</q> I will not be the man that ſhall condemn one Infant to Hell, or unto torments; And here I muſt tell our Author
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:102472:113"/>
that its ſtrange to ſee him contend ſo much for the Scripture to be his Rule, and yet be ſo dogmatical in a matter ſo lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, when he can produce no plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it, nor a conſequence without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive ſtraining, and whereas he objecteth ſome <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and ſome Fathers, I had rather with one <hi>Athanaſius</hi> believe the <hi>Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> and wonder that the whole world was become <hi>Arrian,</hi> then follow the multitude in ſuch a groſs error as that was and is.</p>
               <p>In the next place I ſhall conſider where the ſtrength of his Arguments ly, rather then follow his rambling, for I perceive he makes the greateſt noiſe and clamour when he hath leaſt to ſay, and boaſteth greatly when he hath done nothing.</p>
               <p>The whole ſtrength of this Chapter ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in two <hi>Hypotheſes, Firſt,</hi> that <hi>If Adam had not ſinned, he ſhould have been Immortal. Secondly,</hi> that as the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to man for Juſtification; So Adams ſin is imputed to man for Condemnation.</hi> And to prove theſe two Doctrines upon which much of the <hi>Presbyterian Religion</hi> depends, he ſhould have proceeded candidly, and given us Scripture proofs obvious to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well diſpoſed intelect, whereas he hath
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102472:113"/>
brought no Scripture which any plain man like me can think to relate to ſuch a matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He calleth R: B: tidiculous, for enquiring <hi>if his Adverſary would aſſert every thing that Auguſtine ſaid.</hi> But he ſhould have confeſſed, that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> erred in this very Matter, in ſaying, <hi>That all Infants dying without Baptiſm were demned,</hi> And then have told us, That he who erred in one thing might have erred in the other, But this (tho true) would have wronged his Cauſe.</p>
               <p>His firſt Argument he draws from <hi>Gan. 2. 17. For in the day thou eateſt thou ſhall ſurely die:</hi> Hence he arguds, <hi>Infants</hi> dies <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are guilty of <hi>Original ſin.</hi> This Conſequence is very groſs, for if bodily death had been hereby threatned; Then <hi>Adam</hi> could not have lived one day after the commiſſion of that ſin, whereas he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome hundreds of years after it: And the <hi>Weſtminſter Confeſſion</hi> is wiſer then to make it a part of <hi>Adams</hi> puniſhment in all the firſt five Paragraphs of it, till they joyn actuall ſin with it, calling it only a death in ſin, and a defilement or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our whole nature. But he pleads death is an evil, and no evil could have
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102472:114"/>
befallen t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an if he had not ſinned; This he anſwereth himſelf confeſſing, <hi>That to the Scints, where the ſting of death is taken away, it is no evil:</hi> Therefore, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, death had been no evil to him.</p>
               <p>But I muſt ask him a Queſtion, ſeeing it is conſeſſed by all, that Eternal death is a puniſhment of ſin, from which the Saints are freed? How comes it that the Saints are not freed from bodily death al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? Seeing, according to our Author <hi>Bodily death is no leſs a puniſhment of ſin then Eternal Death is.</hi> If he ſay, That all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were to die becauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, altho all Mankind were not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for it (which yet is nothing but his own aſſertion) How came it that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> and <hi>Ellas</hi> dyed not, but were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated? And that Paul ſaith, <hi>We ſhall, not all die, but we ſhall all be changed,</hi> &amp;c. All which ſeems to bear that the Earth ſhould not have been Etetnal, nor <hi>Adam</hi> have lived Eternally on it, altho he had not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Which being the grand Pillar, upon which he builds his Doctrines of <hi>Original ſin and Reprobation,</hi> he ſhould have proven by plain Scripture or ſound Reaſon, which he hath not done to the ſatisfaction of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102472:114"/>
any Reader, yea he hath ſcarce attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it except by a Rapſody of railling words: But he had an eaſier way to have proven both, and more conſonant to his own Principles, By telling us, <hi>That it was foreordained from Eternity, that Adam ſhould ſin, and that all Mankind ſhould die, and that the far greater part of them ſhould be reprobates, and be damned eternally:</hi> For the <hi>Weſtminſter Catechiſm ſaith, GOD for his own Glory, hath foreordained whatſoever comes to paſs;</hi> But all theſe things comes to paſs; <hi>Ergo,</hi> GOD for his own Glory hath foreordained them.</p>
               <p>His next is <hi>Rom: 6. 23. The wages of ſin is death.</hi> Where, ſaith he, <hi>Death without exception of any kind of death, is called the wages of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Apoſtle had meant more kinds of Deaths then one, it is like he would have ſaid, deaths in the plural number; But the Apoſtle intends here no other kind of death then the ſame kind of Life he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the ſame ſentence, which is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; The words are, <hi>For the wages of ſin is death, But the Gift of GOD is Eternal Life, through Jeſus Chriſt our LORD.</hi> Now to cauſe the firſt ſpeak of bodily death, and the <hi>laſt</hi> of Eternall Life, is ſo ſtrained an
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102472:115"/>
Interpretation, as might nauſeat a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. He would mock R: B: for ſaying <hi>The whole Creation ſuffered a decay for Adams ſin,</hi> But it ſeems he hath forgotten, that GOD curſed the Earth for mans ſake, and yet the Earth was not guilty of Mans ſin; But ſaith he, <hi>The body ſhall after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection live as well as the Soul, and therefore bodily death is a puniſhment of ſin.</hi> This is pretty ſingular, for it is acknowledged by all, that the body is a meer Inſtrument to the Soul; And at this rate, our Anthors Pen is guilty of all the Lies and blaſmphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in his book, and <hi>Patroclus</hi> Swordguil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the blood of all the <hi>Trojans</hi> he killed; But proves nothing that bodily death was here meant by the Apoſtle, yea he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that bodily death is not a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to believers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>Now are we come to his ſecond Argn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I ſpoke of, To wit, <hi>That as we are juſtified by the Righteouſneſs imputed to us, So infants are damned by the ſin of Adam imputed to them.</hi> So that it the firſt be falſe in the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

active and paſſive Obedience both are imputed, then muſt GOD he made to deal with Man according to the <hi>Covenant of works</hi> in the buſineſs of Juſtification, when nothing is more aparent in Scripture, then that by Grace we are Juſtified, and by Grace ſaved.</p>
               <p>A little after he ſaith, <hi>There was no need to bring in this notion of Chriſts imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs into the Church,</hi> But that our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> miſtake themſelves, and forget that we are juſtified and ſaved by the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace,</hi> and not by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> or Covenant of our Creation; And in the foregoing page, he ſaith, <q>

His other Argument, <hi>that Death Reigned from Adam to Moſes,</hi> can prove nothing for bodily Death hath Reigned from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to <hi>Patroclus;</hi> and what than? Ergo, Infants are condemned for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, for none can die but ſinners, this is boldly to begg the queſtion and no more.</p>
               <p>His great Argument in <hi>page 135</hi> is, That ſin which is deſcrived to us by the Apoſtle, that he ſaith, <hi>brought Death upon all men, that men ſinned by it, and were made ſinners, even they who could not as yet actually ſin,</hi> that they all became guilty <hi>of Death and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, That ſin by imputation is the ſin of the whole nature included in Adam, and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole nature obnoxious to death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; But the firſt ſin of Adam is thus deſcribed to us by the Apoſtle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo, that ſin is the ſin of nature.</hi>

which he and all the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the World can never proves from the words of the Apoſtles rightly underſtood, the indeed they have a ſaculty of cauſing the Scripture ſpeak contraries, as we have ſeen and heard at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> upon the Text, <hi>Holineſs becomes thy houſe, O LORD,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I</hi> ſhall therefore inſert one ſentence more of <hi>J: H:</hi>

               <p>In page 146, He oflers us ſeveral preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant arguments (as he words it) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate his Doctrine, as firſt <hi>Infants are deprived of the Image of GOD,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, he proves his conſequence, becauſe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the <hi>Image of GOD</hi> is a puniſhment equal with, if not greater then the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell.</p>
               <p>But our Author hath miſtaken all his meaſures here; For if it be a puniſhment to be deprived of that which a man never had, then it is a puniſhment for <hi>Patroclus</hi> to want the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> (ſo called) that it was a puniſhment to <hi>Adam</hi>

               <p>He is very angry with <hi>George Keith</hi> for ſaying, <hi>The Devil may be called ſin by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonomie,</hi> but he might have remembered that <hi>Paul calls ſin a body of Death, the Old man, the fleſh, and Old Adam,</hi> all which are figurative ſpeeches; Yet he calls <hi>George Keith</hi> a rediculous Babler, he is not the firſt babler who hath reproached him, and this is all the fair dealing we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
               <p>He alſo compleans that <hi>GergeKeith</hi> ſayes, <hi>that to query a thing will not conclude, that the Queſtioniſt doth poſitively affirm or deny what is queried,</hi> which the Author will find true in the query, I have propoſed to him in the end of the laſt Chapter, where I neither deny nor affirm the thing queried. In concluſion, he will have <hi>George Keith,</hi> and the <hi>Queriſts,</hi> to ſay, <hi>that the Devil is Original ſin,</hi> whether he will or not, I ſhall ſet down the Querie.</p>
               <p>What is <hi>Original ſin?</hi> Whether it be not the devil: For doth not Original ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the beginning?</p>

this query, ſtill affirming that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts affirmed hereby the <hi>devil to be Originael ſin,</hi> which he can never prove from the Query; For why may not an Unſcriptur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al word (as Original ſin is) be examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to its meaning, without affirming or denying any thing concerning it? <hi>That the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was &amp; is the Original of all ſin,</hi> I think our Author will not deny: But to ſay, <hi>that GOD made ſo,</hi> is his blaſphemous inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and none of ours, and therefore his concluſion is his own.</p>
               <p>But how affrontedly impudent this poor man is, and how his malice hath blinded him, is evident here, where he ſpendeth two whole pages of his Book, aſſerting <hi>that to query a thing is to affirm it,</hi> and for denying this, he calls his Adverſaries <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, purpoſeleſs; wranglers,</hi> and their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <hi>nonſenſical niceties,</hi> and calls <hi>George Keith</hi> a fool, a knave, and what not, while in page 208 of his book he betakes himſelf to the refuge for defence of his Brother <hi>J: B:</hi> ſaying, he <hi>only enquireth,</hi> and a little after faith, the contrary of which, for any thing I can learn he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth; So that according to this Author, a <hi>Quakers Query</hi> is an <hi>aſſertion,</hi> and a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Query</hi> is a flat denyal, at leſt a

               <p>His third Calumny is, <hi>That we hold the Soul of man to be GOD;</hi> To prove this, he citeth two Authors, <hi>Hubberthorn</hi> and <hi>George Fox;</hi> Theſe books I never ſaw, only I find that <hi>William Penn</hi> hath been aſſaulted with the latter, by our Authors beloved <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt Hicks,</hi> and hath ſo fully anſwered it, that our Author might have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it if he had minded to be ingenuous, he may find it in <hi>Counterfit Chriſtian,</hi> page 68, 69, 70, and 71. But admit all he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth were true (as it is a moſt hateful lie) that theſe two men had believed and written ſo. Was there either honeſty or fair dealing in our Author to charge this on a whole body of People, who had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly denyed any ſuch Doctrine to be intended by the Writers, or owned

               <p>Therefore to ſatisfie all men, who may have occaſion to ſee this, I do hereby for my ſelf, and in the name of my Friends declate, <hi>That we believe the Rational Soul of Man which joyned with the Body, conſtitutes

               <p>I ſhall here only intreat the Reader to take notice of what he ſaith concerning R: B: in the end of page 172, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the next, and to compare this with R: B's <hi>Vindieation</hi> page 190 and 191; That he may ſee what cauſe he hath to boaſt of his <hi>Anaboptiſt Auxilary,</hi> and to call R: B: ridicuſous.

               <p>
                  <hi>His</hi> laſt Citation in page 176, is nothing to his purpoſe, except that any thing which he thinks can blaken the <hi>Quakers,</hi> is pertinent enough. But I muſt ask him here, doth he allow of <hi>Henry Forſides</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, To wit, Being asked, For what end Chriſt wept over <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> He An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; <hi>As he was humane he mourned, and his God-head deareed them to bell:</hi> If thou oweſt this anſwer, thou and he are the Blaſphemers, in aſſerting a will in Chriſt as Man, contrary to the Will of GOD, for no Man mouths for what he deſires, and delights in; But certainly Chriſt as Man, delighted in fulfiling the Decrees of GOD.</p>
               <p>But the words he carps at are, <hi>The Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal tendered over them.</hi> This he calls a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting that moſt pure and impaſſible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the weakeſt Frailties of Mankind; Poor Man!

               <p>In the beginning of page 83.

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:102472:136"/>
blaſphem and deny Jeſus Chriſt as a Perſon without them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What will this Man ſtick to aſſert, who after ſo many accounts of our Faith in this matter, can with an hardned face, and (I may ſay) a ſeared Conſcience aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert ſuch groſs untruths; For which I wiſh the LORD may grant him Repentance. But as the Poet ſaith,—<hi>Nam quis innocens arit, quis triſtiore liberabitur nota, ſi eriminare ſufficit?</hi> I hope the World hath learned by a long Experience, that a <hi>Clergie Man</hi> is not alwayes to be truſted (I had almoſt ſaid ſeldom) when he turns accuſer of the Brethren.</p>
               <p>But to a muſe or rather abule his Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he gives us a bundle of Citations, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Authority of his Friend Mr. <hi>Hieks,</hi> (as he calls him) ſo ſully anſwered in the very places cired by him, and our Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ſully cleared in this matter; That if the man had not been paſt all ſhame, he would not have dared to revive the Dottages of that defated Forger: Who durſt not again attempt to anſwer for himſelf. But this Authors impudence muſt be more then ordinary, who hath throughout his whole Pamphlet been crying out againſt us, as one both with
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:102472:137"/>
                  <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Soceniaus,</hi> whom in page 89<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he calls wicked and abominable; And yet in this place he takes them for his fellow Souldiers againſt the <hi>Quakers:</hi> This is certainly as bad, as to receive the <hi>Mallignants</hi> into the Army: Yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the <hi>Chieff Prieſts, Seribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> in former times.</p>
               <p>But what is the matter he intends by all theſe Citations, Namely, <hi>They deny</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt as a Perſon without them, diſtinct from Chriſt in them.</hi> For cleating of this matter to all unbyaſſed perſons, I ſhall ſtate the matter thus;</p>
               <p>That Chriſt is with and in his Saints is a Doctrine, ſo fully teſti fied to in the Scriptures, that no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an will deny it, <hi>Matth: 28. 20. And lo, I am with you alwayes, even to the end of the World.</hi> Which <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith is meant, of the manner of the preſence of the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> But is abſent from us in Body. In which Body, we acknowledge him, a Perſon without the Saints, &amp; diſtinct from them; As <hi>William Penn</hi> hath told thee, tho thou had the Candour to conceal it, But that Chriſt the LORD from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the <hi>Quickning Spirit is one in the Saints,</hi> and another <hi>diſtinct Perſon without them,</hi>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:102472:137"/>
we deny; And ſuch as affirm it make two Chriſts. See <hi>John</hi> 14. 20, 23. and 15. 4. 5. and 17. 23. <hi>Rom: 8. 10. 2 Cor: 13. 5. Gak 1. 16. Cok 1. 27. Revel:</hi> 3. 20.</p>
               <p>But in the end of theſe Citations, He muſt have a ſecond hit at <hi>H: Forſide.</hi> Is this to tell us again, <hi>That Chriſt as man hath a will contrary to the will of his God-head?</hi> No, But for ſaying that the word <hi>Humane</hi> is no Scripture Language, but ſaith our Author, the thing imported is found in Scripture. He might have minded that the word <hi>Humanus</hi> may be derived from <hi>Humus</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> as well as from <hi>Homo:</hi> And that the Body of Chriſt now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is an Earthly Body, is a very groſs Notion.</p>
               <p>Again page 84. He returneth to <hi>Hicks</hi> and <hi>Faldo,</hi> but citeth us no page, running at random: And truly <hi>Patroclus,</hi> this is an eaſie way of writting Books, if to publiſh all the Lies and Forgeries deviſed, and maliciouſly vented againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> be an honeſt Imployment, thou might have had another Book of that kind written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we noticed this.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only take notice of one of the groſſeſt of them, he nameth <hi>Edward Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:102472:138"/>
but citeth neither book nor page, to which <hi>George Whitehead</hi> in the Appendix before cited by our Author, ſaith, <hi>it is groſs and blaſphemous to ſay, that the Myſterie of iniquity lyeth in the Blood of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Reader, conſider this Mans ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, who but he that would be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch himſelf, could adventure his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation upon ſuch Authority as this? Or would ſpread ſuch impudent calumnies and forgeries after they had been proven ſo fully to be ſuch? certainly it muſt be a bad cauſe that need ſuch Pillars to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop it; But I intreat thee <hi>Patroelus</hi> for the future, <hi>ſpeak Truth and ſhame the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In page 185, he tranſcribes a deal of <hi>Faldo</hi>'s ſtuff, alledging we render the <hi>Paſſion, Death, and Reſurrection of our LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>altogether vain and idle actions, and that we call the Body that our LORD took off the Virgin only a Garment, and that it is no conſtituent part of CHRIST.</hi> A heap of groſs and unparaleled lies. To prove all which he citeth <hi>William Pen</hi> his <hi>Rejoynder, part 2, Chap.</hi> 9. Saying thus, <hi>Whereas it is ſaid that it was revealed to</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>that he ſhould not die till he ſhould ſee the LORDS Chriſt, is to be underſtood of a Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual ſight, or of ſeeing the Chriſt within.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:102472:138"/>Certainly, This muſt be a man of no Credit, nor one that values a good name, tho he begin his Book with it: For if he can produce in that Book or Chapter ſuch an expreſſion of <hi>William Penns,</hi> he ſhall ſurely cauſe Print a new Copie and inſert it; for I aſſure my Reader, there is no ſuch thing, ſo that henceforth our Author deſerves better to be called <hi>Simon</hi> then <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troelus;</hi> Yea, he out does <hi>Faldo,</hi> for <hi>Faldo</hi> accuſeth <hi>William Penn</hi> only for ſaying, that <hi>the Body of Jeſus was not the whole intire Chriſt,</hi> Which <hi>Faldo</hi> labouring to prove, and ſometimes deny, (that any man hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uſe of his Reaſon, might have been aſhamed of) he fully bemires him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and yet our Authors citation is more odious.</p>
               <p>He cometh now to another falſe charge, ſaying, as theſe men <hi>deny CHRIST Himſelf;</hi> So they <hi>deny conſequently all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites purchaſed by him. The Father of lies</hi> could ſcaroely have been more audacious, tho perhaps more cunning then to have Printed himſelf a lier; The <hi>Firſt</hi> is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to be ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>Thus, Unleſs we become doers of that Law which Chriſt came not to deſtroy, but as our example to fulfil, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be juſtified before GOD; nor let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fancy that Chriſt ſo fulfilled it for them, as to exclude their Obedience from being requiſite to their accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but only as their patern, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>This Thread-bare citation hath been many a time caſt in our teeth, and toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over and over to no purpoſe: For <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Penn</hi> hath ſo fully cleared himſelf of it, that no honeſt man would have charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him or us with it, as my Reader may ſee in <hi>Reaſon</hi> againſt <hi>Railing,</hi> page 78, and <hi>Counterfeit Chriſtian detected</hi> from page 22 to page 78, which were too tedious to inſert here, but hath brought an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible brand of infamy upon <hi>Thomas Hicks,</hi> whereof (it ſeems) our Author covets a ſhare.</p>

               <p>A groſſer lie, nor a greater forgerie was never Printed in this Age; What ſhall men do when they deal with ſuch audacious ſlanderes?

For <hi>R: B:</hi> cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>John Browns</hi> words, page 328. 329. <hi>In regeneration, the whole man is changed, ſo that he is now born a new Creature, ſanctified wholly, in Mind, Heart, Spirit, Affection, Conſcience, Memory, and Body, tho but in a ſmall meaſure or degree, yielding Impartial O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience (through the Grace of GOD) unto all GODS Precepts waving none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the Words cited by R. B. and miſerably mancked by our Author, who hath skipped over the moſt matterial parts of his Brothers words, that he may have the more room; but this is a very mean ſubterfuge, and will not long cover him: For, ſaith he, R. B. enquireth, how this Doctrine is reconciled with that of <hi>daily breaking the Commands in thought, Word, and deed?</hi> In anſwer to which queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (ſaith he) It is enough to enquire, <hi>How he
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:102472:143"/>
evineeth them to be contradictory?</hi> Obſerve Reader, That according to this Man, (for I will not think that his brethren will own him) to be changed in the whole Man, to be born a new Creature, to be wholly ſanctified in the mind, heart, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Affections, Conſcience, Memory and Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to break the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands daily in thought, word, and Deed; are no wayes contrary, and need no Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. Behold this Mans Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! And let him tell me with the next, what difference there is betwixt his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Sanctification, and other Mens wickedneſs where malice is wanting.</p>
               <p>As for that he adds, That the Law of the Lord requireth a perfection of degrees as well as as parts; He might have known that we are to be judged by the Goſpel and not by the Law.</p>
               <p>Next he ſaith, And whereas he enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; <hi>If to break Gods Commands daily in Thought, Word, and Deed, be the way to grow in Grace? To put off the Old Man and put on the New?</hi> This he calls a malicious calumny, But who gave the occaſion for it! Did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> B. bring this for a proof, that Men ſin daily in thought, Word and deed, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſtians are <hi>exborted
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:102472:143"/>
to grow in Grace.</hi> To put off the Old Man which is corrupt, to put on the nor Man; to mortifie their Members: And now I leave it to the Reader to judge, whether R. B's queſtion were pertinent, and neither malicious nor calumnious: Yet our Candid Author muſt add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he may ſtill be like himſelf; Asking, Where did any of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed teach, that to endeavour to break <hi>Gods</hi> Commands to grow in Grace, as this Man inſinuates they do? Firſt he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Word (Indeavour) and then he hath fathered the import of l. B's argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon R. B's queſtion. Is this honeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? To tell his Adverſary, <hi>His Light teacheth him a faoulty of Lying,</hi> while him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is both the Lyet and the Forger.</p>
               <p>He goeth no to give us I. B's ſecond Proof. thus, This perfection renders Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Commands uſeleſs: R. B. Anſwers by a Simile, Asking <hi>Are the Laws uſeleſs if Men obey them?</hi> He anſwers. <q>He that is above the Breach of the Law, hath no more uſe of the Law, or need of it, to learn any thing from it, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Obedience thereof.</q> Is not this a poor Subterfuge: How ſhall a Man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Law, if he know it not. Or how
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:102472:144"/>
obey it if he take not heed to order his Converſation according to it? And is then the Law uſeleſs him? But he might have remembred, that R. B. aſſerted a poſſibility of ſinning, and only modeſtly ſaid, he durſt not deny a further State, becauſe the Apoſtle ſeemed poſitively to aſſert it. But the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Againſt ſuch there is no Law,</hi> he may tell us next who theſe are?</p>
               <p>But to ſumm up this <hi>Paragraph</hi> he will not only faſten a contradiction upon R. B. but alſo Blaſphemy, ſaying, But that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hay further contradict himſelf and his Brethren, He ſaith in his Apologie, that <hi>all have need to repent and pray for forgiveneſs: For</hi> (ſaith our Author) <hi>If ſome be equal with God, above the breach of the Commands, want a body of death, the moſt that they have to do is to give Thanks, and not to pray or repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not this a profound as well as fair Diſputant? Did his Adverſary ever ſay, That any were equal with GOD? No: And therefore the Blaſphemy is his own, for which he hath need to repent; And ſo had the beſt Saints, for that all have ſinned, and whoſoever hath ſinned need to repent and pray for Forgiveneſs; And if he will conſult the Scriptures he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:102472:144"/>
may ſee that after the Intimation of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, the Saints have mourned, and prayed for Forgiveneſs. <hi>See</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. Compated with <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51. 14. But his Malice blinds him in this and many more things.</p>
               <p>He comes now to <hi>John Browns</hi> next proof; <hi>Viz: This doctrine tends to foment pride and Securitie, and taketh away diligent Watchfulneſs, Holy fear, Humility,</hi> &amp;c. To which R. B. anſwers, But where Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Sin is, where can pride and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie have place? or Diligence and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility be wanting? But with him to ſin is the way not to be proud and ſecure, but to be watchfull and humble For anſwer he ſends to <hi>Rom. 3. 27. Where is boaſting then? It is excluded, By? what Law of Works? Nay, But by the Law of Faith.</hi> But prithee <hi>Patroclus,</hi> what ſaith this for thee? Are we boaſting in our own ſtrength, or in the ſtrength of the Grace of God? Or do we depend upon the Law of Works? No, But on the Law of Faith, which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth the heart and worketh by Love. If to exalt the Grace of God as ſufficient be to boaſt in thy Senſe, thou haſt Liberty to abound in thy own ſenſe, wherein no good Chriſtian will own thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:102472:145"/>But he giveth us another citation of R B's in theſe words, That according to our Doctrine, <hi>denying the perfection of degrees in this Life,</hi> the wicked Villains do leſs make uſeleſs God commands then others, becauſe they afford more matter to exerciſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Prayer for forgiveneſs of God.</p>
               <p>Will, thou never deal honeſtly, Did R. B. once mention a <hi>perfection of degrees</hi> But to I.

He returns thus, If this his Argument hold true to prove, that Men muſt ſin all their Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and break the Commands every day, in thought, word and deed, then the greateſt ſinners and moſt prefligate Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, do leſs make uſeleſs Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands then others, becauſe they affoord more matter to exerciſe Repentance and Prayer for Forgiveneſs of ſins.

If we confeſs our ſins, He is Faithful and Juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> As for the word Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its having diverſe ſignifications, It may be ſo: But I am ſure it can never be truely predicated of him who breaks the Commands of GOD daily, in Thought, Word, and Deed.</p>
               <p>He comes next to vindicate their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, for the <hi>Devils Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>Sinning Term of Life:</hi> The firſt whereof is. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 3. (miſunderſtood by them) <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin,</hi> &amp;c: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer firſt, I ſay with <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon the <hi>Galatians: Aliud eſt non peccare, aliud non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere percatum.</hi> Secondly, The following words of the Apoſtle are, <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, He is Faithful and Juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs;</hi> And he that is cleanſed from ſin, is the ſame that was before ſaid to have ſin;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:102472:154"/>
Now it is ſaid in the <hi>7th.</hi> verſe, <hi>The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin;</hi> Here cleanſeth is in the preſent Tenſe: Now to be defiled with ſin, and cleanſed from all ſin at the ſame time, ſeems a contradiction, and therefore muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be two ſeveral times; Let our Author ſolve this by a fair Commentaty with the next.</p>
               <p>To his Anſwer, <hi>That it follows no more that the Apoſtle John was at that time defiled with ſin, then that the Apoſtle James was a Curſer, when he ſaid of the tongue, herewith curſe we men;</hi> Our Author Replyes, There is no Parity; And why? Is it becauſe they are both in the plural Number and preſent Time? No, But ſaith he, <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh of groſs outbreakings, and <hi>John</hi> ſimply of the nature of ſin.</p>
               <p>Very good, I ſee our Author can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh betwixt <hi>morial</hi> and <hi>venial ſins;</hi> Of which, ſure lying muſt be one (in his Judgement) or elſe he had been unſaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long ſince. But knowing this would not do, he tells us, the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> even in his beſt Frame, had ſinful actions, and citeth <hi>Revel:</hi> 19. 10, 11. and 22. 8, 9. The firſt place is, <hi>That he falls down at his feet to worſhip him.</hi> And the ſecond is,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:102472:154"/>
                  <hi>That he fell down to worſhip before the feet of the Angel.</hi> Which ſecond place cannot be underſtood of worſhipping the Angel, but of Worſhipping GOD before the feet of the Angel. But admit they both meant ſo, our Author muſt acknowledge this to have been one of his <hi>venial ſins,</hi> if a ſin at all; For it was but a miſtaking the Angel, who in Chapter 18. 1. Is ſaid to have great Power, and the Earth was enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his Glory; I ſay it was but a taking this Angel to have been Chriſt: And therefore he may ſee the LORD did not permit the Apoſtle to commit the ſinful action upon that miſtake, but ſtopped him; And he reads not that <hi>John</hi> offered to worſhip the Angel after he knew him to be his fellow ſervant. And ſo theſe two Texts he boaſts of, can do hm no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>To the reſt in this Paragraph he giveth no Anſwer, but It's falſe; And again, we know, &amp;c: without any Reaſon, but his imperious aſſertion, which deſerves to be neglected.</p>
               <p>Next he indeavours to prove from <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes 7. 20. That Men ſin daily,</hi> &amp;c. Which place he little urgeth, only tells us, He hath conſidered the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:102472:155"/>
hath found it the <hi>Indicative Mood;</hi> So ſaith our Author, <hi>Ergo, verum;</hi> But he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, to think <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Junius, Tremel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> as good <hi>Linguiſts</hi> as he, and yet have tranſlated it in the <hi>Potential Mood, and may not ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next is <hi>Rom:</hi> 7. 17. From which Texts he ſaith <hi>J: B.</hi> hath proved, That the Apoſtle was in <hi>Carnal State</hi> in reſpect of ſinning at that time: But he hath not been ſo juſt as to tell us how he proved it, leaſt his Arguments ſhould have been ſound like theſe, he cites page 200. But I wonder how a Man of Senſe can aſſert it, if he but read the next Chapter through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; The ſecond verſe whereof cleareth this matter, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, had made him free from the law of ſin and death;</hi> And many times after witneſſeth a better Condition; As that he had <hi>ſought the good fight, &amp;c: Nothing could ſeparate him from the Love of GOD, &amp;c:</hi> And <hi>Phil: 4. 13.</hi> I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me. His Objection of the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> is already anſwered. That of <hi>Peter</hi> proves no more then that a Man may ſin, which is not denyed. He comes at laſt to his great Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:102472:155"/>If we find no Inſtances in Scripture of ſuch perſons as were ſo perfect, as that they did not ſin, then to imagine ſuch a Perfection is but a groundleſs fancie and dream: But the former is true. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For anſwer let the Reader obſerve, firſt that our Author finding his Brothers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument fully refuted by R: B: hath not attempted the <hi>Vindieation</hi> of it; But he ſaith, the Argument was proponed three different wayes, the firſt, of which he chooſeth to anſwer unto.</p>
               <p>Anſwer, Either this Argument which he anſwereth unto, was to the purpoſe or not? If it was to the purpoſe it was right to anſwer it; Seeing our Author calls them not three arguments, but one proponed three different wayes, any of which his Adverſary might lawfully chooſe; If it was not to the purpoſe (as was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of his book) then he might have ſpared it; But becauſe R: B: took not our Authors argument to task (which perhaps was not there) he ſaith, he muſt confeſs <hi>he skipt over that which did cut this point of Quakeriſm in the Jugular Vein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a <hi>Rhodomontado expreſſion,</hi> more like <hi>Don: Quixot</hi> then a ſober man writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:102472:156"/>
about Religion, tho very ordinary with our Author; But let us ſee what cauſe there is for all this froath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, I deny his <hi>Minor,</hi> for I can find him many recorded in Scripture, of whom there is no failing recorded; to wit, <hi>Enoh, Melchizedeck, Elias, John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> and many of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and let him prove by Scripture that theſe men <hi>did ſin;</hi> For <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his fourth Oration againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That many were born holy, and free from all ſin, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Elias, and John Baptiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ask him whether the <hi>ſins of the Saints were recorded in Scripture for our imitation,</hi> which he ſeems here to inſinuate, for we ſay not that we ought <hi>not to walk according to the Scripture,</hi> But that the ſins of the Saints are recorded, that we may ſhun them, not that we ſhould follow them; neither is there want of <hi>precep's</hi> and <hi>examples</hi> in <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance</hi> for us without them.</p>
               <p>But before I leave this matter I ſhall give one argument yet, <hi>If there be any who need no Repentance,</hi> then certainly there be ſome who do not break <hi>GOD's Commands dayly</hi> in <hi>thought, word and deed,</hi> but the firſt is true, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved by <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 7.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Yet nevertheleſs, Our Author in his third and fourth anſwer compares us to <hi>Muncer, John</hi> of <hi>Lyden, Arrius, Pelagius,</hi> and what not; And it's much he hath not called us <hi>Papiſts</hi> too: But let the Reader judge whether he hath mended <hi>J: B</hi>'s matter, and not rather added lie to lie, and calumny to calumny.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Calumny he defends is, <hi>That we acknowledge no motion, nor inward brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Spirit, but what is extraordinary, and meerly Enthuſiaſtick;</hi> As alſo, <hi>That we abſtract from all means.</hi> Which Calumny our Author ſaith, he hath above evinced to be a Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his firſt and ſecond Chapters: How truely the Reader muſt Judge.</p>
               <p>But he giveth us a ſecond Inſtance, <hi>R: B:</hi> denyeth that <hi>Studied Sermons are means appointed of GOD,</hi> (for what he adds are his own words, and not <hi>R: B</hi>'s) but behold the <hi>Argument;</hi> Studied Sermons are deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Ergo,</hi> all means are denyed; Be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed.</p>
               <p>His third is, <hi>That the Quakers ſpiritual

life is nothing but Nature,</hi> Thus he ſaith, he proved, Chapter <hi>2d. That all their Grace and Light, is nothing but the ſmall remainders of the once bright ſhining Image of GOD in Man.</hi> To which I alſo refer the Reader. And withall, I muſt deſire the Reader to take notice of our Authors little Tricks, in his Parallel betwixt us and the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> he referrs to what follows of his Book; And in the end of his Book he referrs to what is paſt, thinking (it's like) his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Hearers will take it on truſt; But I expect thou will trace him better, which if thou do, thou will ſoon find what he is for all his vaine boaſt.</p>
               <p>The fourth Calumny he <hi>denyeth,</hi> and ſaith his Adverſary only <hi>enquireth</hi> it. If this be a ſufficient Anſwer, let him conſult his own Book, page 167. 168. and 169. Where he will needs have a <hi>Query</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a <hi>full affirmation</hi> of the thing queried, and ſo proves himſelf ſignally diſſingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and alſo leaves his brother in the myre.</p>
               <p>The fifth Calumny, he ſaith, depends u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Contraverſy about <hi>Perfection,</hi> and ſo ſhifts it.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Calumny, he inſiſts on is, <hi>That

               </p>
               <p>The Nicery is in the word <hi>Previous,</hi> and therefore I ſhall referr him to the fifth <hi>Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Quakeriſm confirmed,</hi> where that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is fully handled, and all his <hi>Quibles</hi> Anſwered; Which Book I perceive the Man hath read, and ſo might either been ſilent, or brought us ſome new thing, which he hath not yet done.</p>

               <p>He tells us next, <hi>That J: B: compareth us to the Old Pithonicks,</hi> And as if his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had not been ſlanderous enough, he adds, I alwayes compared them in ſuch fitts to the <hi>Cumaena Sybilli,</hi> as ſhe is deſcriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Virgil 6.

               </p>
               <p>But our Author giveth us a mighty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference thus, <hi>Theſe at Stuartown after theſe outlettings of the Spirit upon them, cleaved to the Scriptures as the only Rule, and were endeared to the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Word and Sacraments;</hi> We mean, ſaith he, <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Body</hi> in <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> &amp;c: Which ſayes he, were commanded by Chriſt to be uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until his <hi>coming to Judgement:</hi> Which are contemned and vilified by the <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> And for all this, we muſt truſt our Authors word; But how comes it then that our preſent <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who are found in all theſe things now have no ſuch <hi>Outlettings of the Spirit?</hi> Yea, <hi>why are they found the chief Oppoſers and blaſphemers of ſuch Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettings of the Spirit?</hi> If they were good then, I think they ſhould be expected and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for now? But this would ſavour of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm,</hi> and therefore cannot be endured.</p>
               <p>But I muſt tell our Author the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why theſe <hi>Outlettings</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them; <hi>To wit,</hi> Becauſe they foreſook that <hi>Power</hi> which reached them at firſt, and betook themſelves to Men, who in ſtead of the <hi>Goſpel of peace,</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:102472:159"/>
up Warrs, Seditions, Tumults, Scrife, and Contention; And in ſtead of <hi>Prayers, Tears,</hi> preached up Swords and Spears, in ſtead of <hi>Suffering,</hi> fighting, and contending with the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate;</hi> Which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the way of CHRIST not Chriſtians. As for <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> it is no good Argument that they cleaved to them, which are called <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks,</hi> and <hi>Divers Baptiſms,</hi> and <hi>Carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> while they wanted that <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> wherein the Kingdom of GOD ſtandeth.</p>
               <p>But our Author returns to his old trade of citations, and gives us an <hi>Engliſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and <hi>Paget</hi> for his Authors, which books I never ſaw, and may be as great liars as himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who may the next time be cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a famous Author, but admitt all theſe were truths (as they are not) What then? If our Author will but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite me with the next I will give him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable Inſtances of <hi>Presbyterian Prieſts</hi> that have farr out done all theſe Inſtances of his, in abominable wickedneſs, not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> but this is a pitiful way of Reaſoning.</p>
               <p>He cannot omit <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Latinus,</hi> to ſhew us that he reads the <hi>Heathen Poets,</hi> it
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:102472:160"/>
ſeems, as carefully as the <hi>Bible;</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he had never inſerted ſuch a fooliſh tale, as the <hi>Heathen</hi> Lying upon Sheeps Skins; And malitiouſly adds, which if the <hi>Quakers</hi> do, or not, I am uncertain. This one Sentence in the end renders all the reſt uncertain and rediculous: But it is Obſervable in our Adverſaries, that when a <hi>Scottiſh Prieſt</hi> hath a lie to vent he goeth to <hi>England</hi> for it, and in <hi>England</hi> they fetch it from <hi>Scotland, Holland,</hi> or ſome forraignplace at a diſtance, to cover deceit and malice.</p>
               <p>And now at laſt, we are come to <hi>ſilent waiting upon the LORD,</hi> or turning <hi>inward</hi> our <hi>minds</hi> to hear what the <hi>LORD will ſpeak in us;</hi> As <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will hear what the LORD will ſpeak in me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This our Author ſaith, is impoſſible to a man, except he be ſleeping or in an exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; But giveth no proof, but <hi>ipſe dixit;</hi> As for <hi>Extaſies</hi> I know them not, but ſleeping men have their minds ſometimes very buſſe, and even our Author himſelf, I doubt, is not quite free from dreams.</p>
               <p>And becauſe he cites <hi>Virgil</hi> here, I think <hi>he who ſo much delights in Heathen Poets might have been at the pains to read ſome Chriſtian Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets</hi> As <hi>Boetus de Conſol: Phil: 3: lib: metrum:</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But ſaith he, <hi>R. B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Old Man, the Man of ſin that is corrupted, muſt dye, and be crucified;</hi> And again, ſaith he, <hi>albeit in one ſenſe they are ſaid to die: Yet they more truely live,</hi> Gal: 2. 20.</p>

                     </gap>arnal thoughts,</hi> but this he calls a cheat: For ſaith he, <hi>there is a time to be preſuppoſed in which the Spirit is not moving,</hi> &amp;c. And what then? Muſt <hi>Patroclus</hi> Preach? Yea, altho Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Without me ye can do nothing;</hi> Yea, <hi>Calvine</hi> ſaith on the Fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, <hi>The Sabbath is a reſting from our own works, that GOD may Work in us.</hi> As for a time betwixt, which ſeems to be the only thing he quibles upon, I have told before, and now again, that how ſoon the Clouds are diſſipat by a true ſelf-denyal; The <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> immediatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, and there is no <hi>vacuum.</hi> As to what he talketh of the Apoſtle, I hope when <hi>he was dead,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt lived in him,</hi> our Author will not be ſo groſs as to ſay, that he acted without Chriſt as to Spiritual things, tho the faculties of his Soul were as <hi>vived</hi> and <hi>active</hi> as our Authors now are.</p>
               <p>What he ſaith in page 214 on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, only ſheweth his ignorance in theſe things, or want of experience, or that he thinks GOD to be at a diſtance, and to require a time to come to man to work upon him after he hath denyed ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:102472:161"/>His next Quible is concerning appointed <hi>times,</hi> for <hi>meeting together to wait upon the LORD.</hi> Alledging that we ſhould have a <hi>previous motion</hi> to every Meeting, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (ſaith he <hi>They limit the Spirit.</hi> But might <hi>not</hi> our Author have allowed us the uſe of this Interpreter of Scripture in ſuch Externall caſes as appointing Meetings. to wit, His Chriſtian Prudence and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; For I hope our Author will not ſay, that Meeting together is an Act of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and therefore I refer him to <hi>Quaker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm confirmed,</hi> for a full Anſwer to his Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which if he had been juſt, he had taken notice of here.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>Vindication</hi> of <hi>Calvine</hi> about Sabbath Day, he doth him very little kindneſs, telling the World he contradicteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf twenty ſeven years after he had wrote his Inſtitutions: I wiſh he had done ſo with his doctrine of <hi>Reprobation</hi> alſo. But we have many famous <hi>Proteſtants</hi> for us in that matter, as well as <hi>Calvine,</hi> As Dr. <hi>Barnes, William Tindal,</hi> and almoſt all Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>He chargeth R. B. with a contradiction for ſaying, That <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul had a Natural Man,</hi> in which the <hi>devil might work,</hi> and a <hi>Spiritual Man which might reſiſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:102472:162"/>
This he ſaith contradicts his dectrine of Perfection, or at leſt his Expoſition of <hi>Rom:</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>For the ſtrſt, R. B. alwayes aſſerted a Natural and Spiritual Man, as may be ſeen in all his Writtings.</p>
               <p>And for the Second, It is one thing to ſay, <hi>the Devil may work, and the Spirit reſiſt,</hi> and another to ſay, <hi>the Devil doth work and overcome;</hi> The firſt may be ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> in his beſt ſtate; The ſecond is our Adverſarys doctrine which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: And thus his alledged Contradiction is a meet falſe Inſinuation.</p>
               <p>In the next place, he accuſeth R. B. of Railing; He ſhould have ſaid <hi>R. Maequair,</hi> and uſed his own phraſe. <hi>Quis tulerit Graccbos,</hi> &amp;c. But he calls them Prieſts, (ſaith he underſtand of <hi>Baal</hi>) Thus he hath helped R. B. For <hi>conſcius ipſe ſibi de ſe putat omnia dici.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To defend his Brother, ſaying, <hi>That Watching is not a turning inward, but a looking outward.</hi> To which R. B. replyeth: Then a man ſhut up in a dungeon could not watch ſpiritually: He anſwers, That by looking outwardly, they underſtand minding GOD, and our diſtance from him, and the like: This is Nonſenſe, as
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:102472:162"/>
if by looking outward a man could ſee GOD.</p>
               <p>His bauble about <hi>Thaulerus</hi> is nothing but a malicious Inſinuation of our being <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which none that knoweth us will believe: <hi>Thomas a Kempis</hi> was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> yet his Book of the <hi>Imitation of Chriſt</hi> is more ſpiritual, than any <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Book I ever yet ſaw, And if he will call me a <hi>Papiſt</hi> for ſaying ſo, I cannot help it, but I am ſure it is falſe; And if <hi>Popery</hi> ſhould prevail in the Nation (which GOD for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) it would ſoon appear whether they or we were the trueſt <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this matter, It is evident, That our Author is againſt all Spirituall Worſhip, Mental prayer, Quietneſs of mind, &amp;c. As oppoſite to that ſordid Trade of Preaching for hire, and divin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for money: <hi>And if Michael Molmos</hi> (of whom all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that I have ſeen mention him, writ favourably) had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>Glasgow Scotalnd,</hi> when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> It is manifeſt our <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Clergie would have accuſed him as fiercely here, as the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> did there, Which among other things may ſhew that they are not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken who call them Couſin-Germans.</p>

                  <head>Section Second, Of BAPTISM.</head>
                  <p>HERE our Author very wiſely paſſeth by a great part of the Contraverſie; To wit, <hi>whether Sprinkling of Infants,</hi> (the only Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm now in being in the <hi>Presbyterian Church</hi>) be either the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> or of <hi>CHRIST?</hi> Both which we deny; And this our Author ſhould firſt have proved before he had accuſed: For admit another man be wrong in his Religion, he can never be oblieged to change untill his Adverſary prove his to be right. Neither is it juſt to deſire him to come from his own, (tho wrong) to yours, except you can prove yours to be right: But for this he muſt conſult his good Friend <hi>Hicks</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> whoſe weapons he hath often borrowed in this conflict.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Weſtminſter Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> chap. 27. num. 4. ſaith, <hi>Neither of the Sacraments may be diſpenſed by any,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:102472:163"/>
but by a Miniſter of the Word lawfully ordained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we deny that any of the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Prieſt-hood</hi> are ſuch, and therefore (tho theſe ſings were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue) they may not diſpenſe them. Theſe our Authour knewwell enough, but skips over them.</p>
                  <p>But it is obſervable, That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cited in the Confeſſion to prove this Article, do all of them point to an <hi>inward Call,</hi> one is <hi>Hebrews 5. 4, and no man taketh this honour to himſelf, but he that is called of GOD as was Aaron:</hi> I hope this was not to derive his Call from an Apoſtate Idolatrous Church, as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> from which our <hi>Presbyterian Prieſts</hi> are not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to derive theirs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that theſe ſigns are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation, and in the time of their laſt Reign, limited Baptiſm to Preaching dayes, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Children of Ignorant or
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:102472:164"/>
Scandalous Parents, by which means many Infants dyed without it, Tho they ſay that the <hi>contempt</hi> of <hi>it is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:</hi> And ſince the late Revolution, I read of one of them who ſaid, <hi>It was but the Relicts of Popiſh Superſtition to be curious for Baptiſing of Children;</hi> And <hi>that he knew a good and godly Miniſter who lived to a great Age, and was never Baptized.</hi> What then needs all this clamour againſt us.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing he takes notice of, is, <hi>the many diviſions and diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians about theſe Signs,</hi> which he faſly calls one of R. Bs. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logetical Arguments, whereas it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a part of his Introduction, as any that reads his <hi>Apology</hi> may ſee: And in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> he tells his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary <hi>page</hi> 162. he hath not uſed it as an Argument at all; And in his <hi>Apologie</hi> tells them, how much it would contribute to Peace, that they would lay aſide ſuch Heathniſh and Barbarous words as theſe: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs our Authour will have him a
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:102472:164"/>
Heathen for this advice to procure u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but it is too manifeſt that tho <hi>Salamanders</hi> we have to do with are <hi>Peace-haters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, he falls upon the word <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> which he muſt confeſs is not a Scripture expreſſion, and from this draweth a fooliſh conſequence, to wit, <hi>Ergo, the thing is not in them;</hi> he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Ergo, its a Humane invention,</hi> introduced by the Apoſtacy. and therefore to be laid aſide by the Reformation, but he is not ſo ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but he ſaith, the word <hi>Trinity</hi> is not to be found in <hi>Scripture;</hi> but the thing imported by the word is, Why may not then the Scripture words be uſed, and both theſe words laid aſide? Except our Clergie think they can word better than the <hi>Spirit of GOD.</hi> But our Authour who is ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint with the Latine Poets, cannot be ſo ignorant of their Hiſtorians as not to know the true and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſignification of <hi>Sacrament</hi> to be a</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:102472:165"/>
                     <hi>Military Oath;</hi> And therefore I think there is no <hi>presbyterian</hi> ceremony that I know which ſo well deſerves the name of a Sacrament as the <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His next buſineſs is to deal with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 4. 5. from Which R. B. proves there is but one Baptiſm, to which <hi>J. Brown</hi> anſwereth, <hi>the Scripture no where ſaith, that there is but one only Baptiſm.</hi> To which R. B. replyeth, it will as well prove that there is one onely Baptiſm, as that there is One only GOD: But our Author very can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly quites the matter, and betakes himſelf to Faith; And becauſe <hi>there are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>more kinds of Faiths than one, the Text muſt be ſo expounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Baptiſm:</hi> But let me have the one Faith and the one Baptiſm men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here, and our Author may take all the reſt to himſelf, for there is a falſe Faith which I covet not.</p>
                  <p>But in page 219: he aſſerteth, <hi>That the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt is ceaſed;</hi>
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:102472:165"/>
And in page 224: he boldly aſſerts, <hi>That Johns Baptiſm is Chriſts whole true Baptiſm,</hi> but ſayes nothing to prove it.</p>
                  <p>From which Doctrine it followeth, That whoſoever is Baptized with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is Baptized with the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That as many as are baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with water have put on CHRIST. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> erred grievouſly in <hi>Acts</hi> 19: when he ſaid, <hi>unto what then were ye baptized, ſeeing they had received Johns Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm before:</hi> But the man is ſo confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all through this Section, that he knows not what he aſſerts, for in the ſame page 219: he again aſſerts, <hi>That Johns Baptiſm was no Figure of the New Teſtament Baptiſm;</hi> this he aſſerts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proof, yet fearing it may not paſs, he adds, <hi>Otherwiſe if the Sign be oppoſed to the thing ſignified, we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, and Fire, ſpoken of Matth: 3: of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Mortification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What a hodg-podg is this! <hi>Schition</hi>

like to fight and flee, or to change ſhapes like a <hi>Proteus;</hi> And firſt tells us Dogmatically, <hi>it is no Figure;</hi> And then, <hi>if it be as a ſign oppoſed to thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>Sanctification</hi> as well <hi>Mortification is a part of the one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> is not denyed.</p>
                  <p>To R: Bs. ſaying, it is alye, That he would have none to be Baptized in the Spirit, but ſuch as are endued with theſe Extraordinary Gifts: To this I ſay, he anſwers; <hi>But do they not ſtill boaſt of their Revelations, and Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, comparing themſelves to the Apoſtles, calling themſelves perfect, &amp;c.</hi> A heap of groſs untruths; And yet this is the beſt return we, meet with, to mend one lie by making two or three more.</p>
                  <p>In page 220: contrary to that of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ:</hi> 4: 5: from which R: B: infers, if Water Baptiſm be to continue, there ſhould be two Baptiſms. J: B: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>it might be as well ſaid, that there were two Circumciſions under the Old Teſtament, &amp;c.</hi> Upon which our
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:102472:166"/>
Authour ſaith, <hi>he grants his conſequence,</hi> and challengeth his Adverſary <hi>of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> for ſuch an Argument: Here he begins with a lie, for R: B: ſaith, if he can anſwer no better then by ſmyling at it, we muſt pity the Levity of his Spirit. Now let the Reader judge, if the Argument was the ground of the challenge; or his laughing at that which he could not anſwer. But R: B: anſwereth, What then? As long as the outward continued there were two; to wit, the <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> that of the Fleſh and that of the heart; and let him ſtretch the ſimile as far as he can, it will help him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom. 2. 28. That it is not Circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh,</hi> becauſe it was a Figure, and all Figures were to ceaſe, even ſo of the other: That is not CHRISTS Baptiſm which is outward, to the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>I Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:102472:167"/>But he comes again to Faith, ſaying, <hi>he may as well conclude from this place, that there is but one Faith, as that there is but one Baptiſm.</hi> And yet faith our Author, there are diverſe kinds of Faith mentioned in the Scripture, as the <hi>Doctrine of Faith, Galat.</hi> 1. 23. The <hi>profeſſion of Faith, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 19. The <hi>Faith of Miracles,</hi> or the like; This is (if learned at all) ſo learned, that I freely acknowledge I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, to wit, that the profeſſion of Faith is one Faith, the Doctrine of Faith another, The Faith of Miracles a third Faith, And the One Faith a fourth Faith, in which none of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Three are concerned: This will require four ſeveral and different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, which when our Author giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, we may judge of the truth of his aſſertion, till then he muſt excuſe me to think he deſerves a ſmyle, no leſs then R. B. did from his Brother J. B. and will find he hath begged the Queſtion as well as his Brother did
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:102472:167"/>
For I perceive he builds upon his own miſtake, That no man who hath this one Faith can miſcarry. But I tell him, ſome have made ſhipwrack of Faith, and of a good Conſcience. And this is the Scripture teſtimony: So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſome might work Miracles, and thereafter become wicked; yet this faith nothing againſt their having true Faith at that time: And if, he faith, <hi>every one who hath true faith, doth not work miracles;</hi> The anſwer is eaſie, ſuch a great meaſure of Faith is not required for Salvation, yet difference in the meaſure makes no difference in the kind. Neither doth it follow, that Baptiſm with Water is included in this one Baptiſm; For the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> plainly contra-diſtinguiſheth them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Robert Barclays</hi> Argument (which <hi>Patroclus</hi> (minding his old Friend <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi>) mocks at, ſtands in full force; Which becauſe he hath ſo minchingly ſet down, I will ſet down at large,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:102472:168"/>
and expect a more ſolid anſwer next, the Argument is this, <hi>ſeing ſuch as were baptized with water, were not therefore baptized with the Baptiſm of CHRIST, therefore water Baptiſm cannot be the Baptiſm of CHRIST.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But he comes to his old trade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, accuſing R. B. of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> and a little after muſt be at Circumciſion again, alleadging that what ever can be ſaid againſt Water Baptiſm from I <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. Will militate as much againſt Circumciſion under the Law.</p>
                  <p>But it is manifeſt, that the Law was a Figurative, Typical and Shadowy-Diſpenſion, which ſtood in mears and drinks, and diverſe Baptiſms and Carnal Ordinances impoſed on them untill the time of Reformation: But that the Goſpel was ſuch a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, I think our Author will not dare aſſert; And therefore the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is very evident, that altho Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was to continue among the reſt Carnal Ordinances until the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102472:168"/>
time of Reformation; Yet the Goſpel being a <hi>ſpiritual diſpenſation,</hi> in which Carnal Ordinances, Types &amp; Shadows were to ceaſe after the <hi>Subſtance</hi> was come, ſee <hi>Col.</hi> 2. from 16. to the end; ſo <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm was to ceaſe among the reſt of the ſhadows, ſeeing <hi>John</hi> was ſent only to the <hi>Jews</hi> to prepare the way of the LORD.</p>
                  <p>His next aſſault is nothing but wind and froth, wherein he challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth R. B. for denying <hi>John Browns</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Which J. B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>may be underſtood of putting on CHRIST by profeſſion, tho not in Truth and Reality;</hi> For which Epoſition ſaith R. B. I ſhall expect his proof next time, if he hath any. And now let the Reader judge, if our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor have any ground for his boaſting: And whether he who hath undertaken the defence of <hi>John Brown</hi> was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have proven this ſpurious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of his Brother to be the meaning of the Apoſtle: For <hi>Robert
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:102472:169"/>
Barkclay</hi> was no further concerned then to deny it, as I think any ſincere Chriſtian will do: And therefore it is manifeſt, that the ſeared Conſciences are his own &amp; his Brothers; who dare adventure to cheat the World, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſenſo upon the Apoſtles words, which was never intended by him.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he referrs us to <hi>J. Brown,</hi> which is a fair <hi>Go-by,</hi> but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns (more like a Pope than a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, if they be diſtinguiſhable) very imperiouſly. Next, <hi>I ſay</hi> (faith he) <hi>that Johns Baptiſm, as being inſtituted by CHRIST, and comprehending the thing ſignified, is not only Baptiſm with Water, but CHRISTS whole true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and ſo this quibling is groundleſs.</hi> And why? Becauſe our Authour ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo. But leſt he ſhould quarrel, let us conſider what he hath ſaid, Firſt, <hi>then,</hi> faith he, <hi>Johns Baptiſm, as being inſtituted by CHRIST, &amp;c. Anſwer,</hi> That all the Baptiſms, and Carnal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Law were inſtituted
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:102472:169"/>
by CHRIST is not denyed; But that <hi>Johns Baptiſm</hi> was inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> after he took <hi>Fleſh</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> is denyed, and the Scriptures proves the contrary, <hi>Acts 19. 4.</hi> Next he faith, <hi>and comprehending the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi> Very well, I hope our Author will no more quarrel with the Papiſts about <hi>opus operatum:</hi> For if Water Baptiſm (<hi>Johns baptiſm</hi>) comprehend the thing ſignified, then it is the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Regeneration, conſers Grace, and is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Papiſts will hardly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him, for, <hi>conveniet nulli qui ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum diſſidet ipſi.</hi> He hath ſaid in page 219. <hi>that John could only adminiſter the ſign.</hi> And in his other page, he aſſerts, <hi>That Johns Baptiſm comprehends the thing ſignified:</hi> this language will need a gloſs.</p>
                  <p>He comes now to the words of <hi>John, He muſt encreaſe, but I muſt decreaſe:</hi> This our Authour and his Brother will have to be underſtood of their perſons
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:102472:170"/>
And after ſome of his ordinary vanity, tells his meaning thus, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer therefore, that the meaning of the place is, <q>That the Perſon of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to grow more and more in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, ſo that within a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Fame and Repute of <hi>John</hi> was to be Eclipſed through the Brightneſs and Splendor of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </q> To this (I think) his own phraſe may be added, <hi>ſpectatum admiſſt riſum tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atis, &amp;c.</hi> For where did the <hi>Jews</hi> call <hi>John</hi> a Devil? Did not they receive <hi>him ak a Prophet? Or did they call him a Glutton, and a Drumkard? Or did they cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him, or ſeek his life;</hi> If <hi>Herod</hi> had let him alone? All which ſhew that they honoured the perſon of <hi>John</hi> more than the Perſon of CHRIST: But it is evident that <hi>Johns</hi> Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to decreaſe, as being only to prepare the way to CHRISTS Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, whoſe Miniſtry then eclipſed the Miniſtry of <hi>John,</hi> as it hath done ever ſince: And therefore if he be not
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:102472:170"/>
yet pleaſed, he muſt give usa more ſound expoſition next.</p>
                  <p>In the end of page 224. he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to prove, that the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was no Legal Rite; His firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is, <q>All the Legal Rites, ſuch as held forth CHRIST and his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſites by way of Type to the whole Church, which each Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was to practiſe, were either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitut by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or before him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this could not be a Legal Rite, which was commanded directly at the coming of the <hi>Miſſiah,</hi> and at his very appearance, preaching to the World, When there could be no uſe of Legal Rites, but ſuch, which were withing a little to be aboliſhed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer, Firſt,</hi> I deny that any Rite was inſtitute by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant he publiſhed the Inſtitution of theſe Rites to the People, and Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, and theſe before him in his Writings; ſo that if GOD had ſeen it meet He could have added new Rites
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:102472:171"/>
by any other of His ſervants, as He did this of Baptiſm by <hi>John,</hi> who was as great as <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> This Rite which was commanded directly at the comming CHRIST, when there could be no uſe of Legal Rites, but theſe which were within a little time to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ought now (as it is long ſince) to be aboliſhed. Theſe are his own words.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Argument is, <hi>All the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Rites are abrogate in the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, but no where is Baptiſm abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, &amp;c.</hi> Otherwiſe, ſaith he, <hi>ſhew me the place of Scripture; but note 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 21. Is not this a fair Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary? If <hi>Hector</hi> had been adviſed by <hi>Patroclus</hi> what Arms to uſe, he might readily have eſcaped his hand. But <hi>Patroclus</hi> muſt take this Scripture in the firſt place, for the Repeal or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogation of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm; And leſt he ſhould grumble, I ſhall add <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 2, 3, 4. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. with <hi>John</hi> 3. 30.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:102472:171"/>His third Argument is <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>All the Prophets, and the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied untill John:</hi> And What then? Was not <hi>John</hi> one of the Prophets? Yes, and that a great One, <hi>yet the leaſt in the kingdom of Heaven is greater than be;</hi> Which evidently proves he was no Goſpel Prophet: As for his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of taking the <hi>particle Untill,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively by the collation of places, I tell him, I have found him trip ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I ſhall not take his word.</p>
                  <p>His fourth Argument is to prove <hi>John was no Legal Miniſter, becauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of before he came, which no Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Thing, Perſon, or Rite was.</hi> But here he runs too faſt, the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were propheſied of by <hi>Balaam;</hi> And <hi>Judah's</hi> Soveraignity was propheſied of by <hi>Jacob,</hi> and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 28. But if <hi>Iohn</hi> was a Goſpel Miniſter, how then was the leaſt in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven greater than he?</p>
                  <p>In page 126. he comes to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. Where <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>CHRIST ſent
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:102472:172"/>
me not to Baptize,</hi> to this <hi>Iohn Brown</hi> anſwereth, <hi>If Paul had not been put to Baptize, why would he have done it?</hi> R. B. Anſwereth, <q>I think it needleſs for me to anſwer the abſurdity he would here fix upon the Apoſtlo; it ſufficeth me, and I hope will other good Chriſtians, that the Apoſtle ſaith poſitively, <hi>he was not ſent to Baptize;</hi> This our Author quarrels at, and in the end ſaith, <hi>he knoweth that we expone Pauls words, [That he was not ſent to Baptize] for the leſs principal part of his Errand, and citeth Hos. 6. 6. Matth. 9. Ierem.</hi> 2. 23.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt two are the ſame, to wit, <hi>I deſired Mercy and not Sacrifice,</hi> and are explained by the context, and the knowledge of GOD more then <hi>Burnt-Offerings;</hi> And that of <hi>Ierem. 2. 23. I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim,</hi> is not at all to the purpoſe; Except he will ſay, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were unjuſtly accuſed, which I think he will be afraid to aſſert. That all the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:102472:172"/>
                     <hi>Corinthians</hi> were Baptized with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he doth not prove; And it was known to be deferred by many of the Primitive Chriſtains untill their old Age: And altho <hi>Paul</hi> reproved the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious ſticking to <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites, yet ſome of them were continued even to <hi>Tertullians</hi> time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſaith, <hi>That paul doth not ſay, that his Fellow Apoſtles were not ſent to Baptize, but himſelf alone;</hi> But ſaith he not, <hi>That he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to any of them, but that he had laboured more, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, That ſtill he did adminiſtrat this Sacrament to the Gentiles, upon their embracing Chriſtianity, which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Mr.</hi> Brown <hi>hath ſhewed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Authour might have borrowed this from J. B. and given us a hint of it; For where J. B. hath any thing of worth (in his eſteem) we are ſure to get it, and very little elſe. To take <hi>Not,</hi> for the <hi>not principal part,</hi> would make work. R. B. hath ſhewen
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:102472:173"/>
by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5. which our Authour is it at leaſure to concern with, and therefore his reaſonleſs Reaſons are rejected.</p>
                  <p>In page 227. he comes to <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. Where he ſaith, <hi>R. B.</hi> Denyeth <hi>that while CHRIST was with the Apoſtles they baptized with CHRISTS Warrand.</hi> And ſayes, <hi>he will wait his Adverſaries proof of it.</hi> To this our Authour, he hath done it already from <hi>John.</hi> 3. 26. and 4. 3. <hi>of which places the Quaker durſt not take notice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this is falſe, is evident, becauſe <hi>R. B.</hi> rejects it as a ſufficient proof; and the ſecond citation (which ſhould have been <hi>John</hi> 4. 2.) ſheweth that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port brought to <hi>John</hi> in the former ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was a miſtake, and therefore the firſt citation is to no purpoſe: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, <hi>Tho JESUS himſelf baptized not, but his Diſciples;</hi> Doth this ſay any thing more for their having a Warrand to Baptize, then to fulfill all the <hi>Levital Law,</hi> which was not yet
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:102472:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
abrogate, nor <hi>nailed to His Croſs?</hi> Did not He command ſome that were heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to go to the Prieſts, and offer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law of <hi>Moſes?</hi> But alſo <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſm was not then ceaſed; <hi>Iohn</hi> was alive, and ſome who had been <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples were become <hi>CHRISTS</hi> Diſciples, and ſo were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to Baptiſe; And we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an account of the warrand he pleads for from CHRIST, as a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>But R. B. ſaith, <q>What if it were all granted? Did not the Apoſtles prepare and eat the Paſſover with CHRISTS Warrand and Authority, is it therefore to continue?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He anſwers, <hi>There is no parity;</hi> firſt, <hi>Becauſe the eating of the Paſſover was not impoſed upon the Gentiles, as acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequent of their imbracing Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Which he ſaith, Baptiſm was. This he had no leaſure to prove, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not: For I hope he will confeſs that <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> had
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:102472:174"/>
Imbraced Chriſtianity, when he ſat as a Member of the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> and yet was not baptized for diverſe years after: Neither can he be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of many Gentiles who were not Baptized for many years after their imbracing the Chriſtian Faith, and that even after Superſtition began to creep in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſaith, <hi>The Paſſover was an old Legal cuſtom, whereas Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was in its very uſe.</hi> Well then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Authour it was the nearer its fall, who tells us in page 225. <hi>There could be no uſe of Legal rites then, but ſuch as were within a little to be aboliſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Page 228. he cites R. B. <hi>ſaying,</hi> 
                     <q>That tho it be joined with Diſcipline, as Circumciſion was with it among the Jews; it will no more follow, that Baptiſm is to be continued then Circumciſion.</q> He anſwereth, that the Baptiſm ſpoken of, to wit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. is to continue he thinks,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:102472:174"/>
                     <hi>Robert Barkclay</hi> will not deny: But the Queſtion is whither this be water-Baptiſm, to prove the continuance whereof he brings this Scripture, which ſeeing it is not to be <hi>continued,</hi> cannot be here <hi>intended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, where they object the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of the Apoſtles: This R. B. ſaith, <q>The practice and teſtimony of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> declares to be falſe; this ſaith he, we have proved above to be falſe; but the Reader muſt be judge, to whom I leave it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, he proves, <hi>that abſtinance from blood and things ſtrangled were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogate by 1 Cor:</hi> 10. Where I will be oblidged to him to ſhow me one word of either the two. Next he gives us two whole Epiſtles, <hi>Galat:</hi> and <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> without citing either Chapter or Verſe, becauſe he could not: But that theſe two continued in the Church even in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time; I have told him above: So that his
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:102472:175"/>
Abrogation hath not been intelligible to the Primitive Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Argument is but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of what he hath ſaid before, <hi>That Baptiſm was alwayes upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their embracing CHRIST,</hi> which is falſe as I have ſhewed before. He ſaith, There is another ground given for <hi>Water Baptiſm,</hi> then Condiſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Jews;</hi> But he ſhould have told by whom; For except himſelf, I yet know no other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Either the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles unrepealed Practice was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to walk by, or elſe this was abrogate afterwards;</hi> But ſaith he, <hi>The laſt is falſe, and the firſt is abſurd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The firſt I have already ſhown from Scripture, and the laſt is no abſurdity; Except it be ſo to the <hi>Presbyterian Prieſts,</hi> who pretend to be the Apoſtles Succeſſours, and yet are not found in their unrepealled Practiſes, <hi>Viz: To heal the Sick, to teach all Nations, and to Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:102472:175"/>
freely;</hi> Which laſt, our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are ſo farr from doing, that ſome of them have not been aſhamed to Print and publiſh to the World, <hi>Nos non gratis accepimus, ergo neque gratis dare tenemur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next he promiſeth us two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for one, where the Word <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> is taken for Baptiſm with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> We ſhall expect his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue with the next; And yet he may give us ten for Circumciſion in the Fleſh, for one of Circumciſion in the Heart; Tho the firſt be abrogate and the latter continueth.</p>
                  <p>Page 230. He gives us an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus, <hi>To baptiſe with the Spirit is not in all the Scripture applyed to Men; Therefore it is not ſafe without very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide Reaſons to expone it ſo here.</hi> This I Confeſs, is modeſt, and therefore I ſhall modeſtly anſwer him, I never look'd upon Men as more then Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, neither in this nor in Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the New Covenant: Chriſt

is the principal Teacher as well as the principal Baptiſer of His People, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom they can do nothing. And therefore, I juſtly reject all ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters as profeſs that they can teach or baptiſe without the Immediate Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>His next is an Old Quible renewed thus, <hi>All that they underſtand by this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Baptiſm, is ſufficiently expreſſed in the Context.</hi> This hath been often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and as often denyed, and the contrary proved; And therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no anſwer upon his bare Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: See <hi>Truths Defence,</hi> Page 129. where this is fully diſcuſſed: For the greateſt part of his work hath been to bring up old Stuff in a new Dreſs, knowing it will paſs with ſuch as have pinned their Faith on the Sleeves of ſuch Teachers, eſpecially having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them in his Epiſtle to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with a <hi>Touch not, Taſte not, Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not (leſt ye be informed and find out the cheat.</hi>

                  <head>Section Third, Of the SUPPER, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>HE begins with a Lie, great Saying, <hi>We deny the LORDS Supper:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we affirm, <hi>That except a Man eat his Fleſh and drink his Blood, he hath no Life in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After he hath paſt by a whole page of <hi>R. B's. Vindication,</hi> He comes at laſt to J. B's. <hi>Preaching to the Devil,</hi> and denyes it to be his, but only an Inference from our Doctrine; But the Truth is, That upon R. B's. ſaying, <hi>The Goſpel is to be preached to every Creature under Heaven,</hi> which is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Language, Iſay, If upon this Text, <hi>John Brown</hi> make a preaching to the Devil, who is to blame? Whence it is a apparent, that his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile about Murther, is Noneſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Next he comes to the <hi>Prieſt</hi> near <hi>Lawder,</hi> who <hi>prayed to the devil;</hi>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:102472:179"/>
This R. B. doth not aſſert for a truth, but only tells he heard it, and ſo is no Calumniator. But if I ſhould ſay, I have heard and read many as groſs things of ſome of you, I ſhould neither Lie nor Calumniat: See the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Eloquence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next Paragraph he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but accuſeth R. B. for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reaſon his Adverſary gave for his denyal, and then exclaims. But why ſhould I take notice, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> Now ſhould not our Author rather have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced this Reaſon? If it had been worth his while he had not skipt over it. But when he perceives it will not do, it is enough for him to ſay, <hi>John Brown hath done wonders, why ſhould I take notice,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Next he comes to <hi>Matth:</hi> 14. 19. Which R: B: ſayes (according to our Author) will as much prove a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the places of the Goſpel, and the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly brought can do it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:102472:180"/>Here Reader thou haſt another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his deceit, for clearing whereof I ſhall ſet down R. Bs. words, he asketh, <hi>What ſignifieth CHRISTS bleſſing of the Bread, breaking, giving it to his Diſciples, deſiring them to eat? Anſwer,</hi> Chriſt bleſſed the Bread, break it, and gave it to his Diſciples to eat, and they to others, where themſelves confeſs no ſuch Sacrament or Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as they would have here is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceable, ſee <hi>Matt. 14. 19. Mark</hi> 6. 41. Now let the Reader judge of this mans ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>But, ſayes he, <hi>R. B. never inferred any thing of this kind from ſimple bleſſing, but from other things conſidered with bleſſing; ſuch as this is my Body, this is my Blood; And the unrepealled com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Inſtitution, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. and the like.</p>
                  <p>What Foppery is this? Doth he think to inferr the real Preſence from theſe words, <hi>this is my Body?</hi> Or will his meer aſſertion ſatisfie, that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:102472:180"/>
was a command for continuance of of that Sign? For to call it the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is noneſenſe, being inſtitute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> was a Chriſtian: but to uſe his own words, he hath done as well as he can, and is to be excuſed, if he would but ceaſe to boaſt.</p>
                  <p>That which followes is no better, where he citeth <hi>R. B.</hi> ſaying, he ſaith indeed, that the inſtitution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. was a permiſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When will this man learn to deal honeſtly? upon R. B's. ſaying, That 1 <hi>Cor: 11. Will not prove the neceſſity of its being now performed,</hi> J: B: ſayes, <hi>That then it was an act of will worſhip and ſuperſtition.</hi> R: B: Anſwereth, <q>What is done by permiſſion for a time, is not Will Worſhip and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, <hi>&amp;c:</hi>
                     </q> Now it concerned our Author to prove that there was no Inſtitution of this Rite before this Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> And in that caſe he had delivered his Brother, and made it an act of Will-Worſhip.
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:102472:181"/>
For his ſaying, <hi>That</hi> R: B: <hi>granteth there was a Command for this Practiſe, is nothing to his purpoſe, for he did not ſay, this was it, but another before it;</hi> And ſo this was no <hi>Will-Worſhip</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> nor any proof for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
                  <p>The next is about <hi>waſhing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples feet,</hi> and his expreſs Command, that they ſhould waſh every one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers feet. To which he anſwereth, <hi>John Brown</hi> hath ſhewed diſparity; And that R: B: ſaith meer nothing, but calleth him a <hi>Pope.</hi> This every Man that will be at the pains to read the place, will find to be a groſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, but this is ordinary.</p>
                  <p>His next in page 234. Where he citeth <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. to prove that the circumſtances are not to be obſerved: The words (it ſeems) are, when the Diſciples came together to break Bread, <hi>Paul</hi> preached unto them, and therefore ſay our Adverſaries, <hi>This was a Sacramental Eating, &amp; no circumſtance
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:102472:181"/>
to be obſerved.</hi> A ſingular Conſequence and well worthy our Author; May he alwayes diſpute thus againſt us; And 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11. 18, 20. I deſire he may tell us next what relation it hath to his matter.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he begins with <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. And complains that R: B: denyes this to be meant of the <hi>LORDS Supper.</hi> But herein he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth <hi>Beza</hi> who in his notes upon this place, ſaith, <hi>The Jews uſed thinn Loaves, and therefore they did rather break them then cut them.</hi> So by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread they underſtand that liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, and the Banquets which they uſed to keep. The Reader may ſee what trouble it is to trace him to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But he cometh again to <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. And ſaith <hi>R: B:</hi> ſlighteth his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries Reaſon; Which is another groſs Lie, as the Reader may ſee, <hi>Vind:</hi> page 172. But why doth he not bring ſome thing to help his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:102472:182"/>
and not tell us he hath done all; When all Intelligent and Unbyaſſed Men judge he hath done more hurt then Good to his own Cauſe; And yet this Section is nothing but a meer <hi>Elogie</hi> upon J: B's: Book.</p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to <hi>Numb:</hi> 20. Saith our Author, <hi>R: B: bringeth nothing but meer Aſſertions, falſe Suppoſitions, ſuch as that the Corinthians were ſupperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in that they at all practiſed this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the LORDS Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I acknowledge he muſt be ſharper ſighted then I, who can ſee theſe words in <hi>R: B's: Vindication,</hi> upon <hi>Numb:</hi> 20. or any where elſe. But being near the cloſe, he begins to Dream again, and may perhaps be <hi>Simon</hi> next, becauſe he was <hi>Patroclus</hi> laſt, and ſure he is more like the firſt, for Lying and Deceit is the beſt part of his work.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>R: B's:</hi> Saying, That 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11. 26. Is to be underſtood of <hi>Chriſts Inward and Spiritual Coming, Apol:</hi>
                     <pb n="369" facs="tcp:102472:182"/>
page 341, and his <hi>Vind:</hi> page 173, He giveth no Anſwer; But it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at all to impugne this diſtinction, its own groundleſneſs ſufficiently doth it.</p>
                  <p>This is like a mighty Man, and well worthy a <hi>Groecian Hero.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now he is come to his <hi>ultimus conatus,</hi> which (he muſt excuſe me to tell him) is of all his Book the moſt ridiculous. For to conclude from the Abrogation of Rites, Signs, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, <hi>That preaching the Goſpel was alſo abrogate.</hi> To prove this, he ſaith, it will as well follow from <hi>Col:</hi> 2. 20. That preaching the Goſpel is abrogate, as from <hi>verſe</hi> 16. and <hi>Rom:</hi> 14. 17. That the <hi>LORDS Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> is abrogate. I ſhall therefore ſet down the Words, and leave it to the Judgement of the Reader, <hi>Rom: 14. 17. For the Kingdom of GOD is not meat and drink, but Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. Col: 2. 16. Let no Man therefore judge you
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:102472:183"/>
in meat or in drink or in reſpect of an Holy Day, or of the new Moon, or of the Sabbath Dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall now add his Citation for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogating of preaching, <hi>Col: 2. 20. Wherefore if ye be dead with CHRIST from the Rudiments of the World, why as tho living in the World are ye ſubject unto Ordinances? Touch not, Taſte not, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if the LORDs Supper as uſed by you, be not Meat and Drink, I know nothing what Bread and Wine are. But what a Commentary will this 20. verſe need to cauſe it intend preaching of the Goſpel? I remember the <hi>Presbyterian Dialect</hi> was wont to run thus; To hear Sermon, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Haunting of the Ordinances; And to abſtaine, was called a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunting of the Ordinances: And therefore it ſeems he underſtands the word Ordinances in the 20. verſe for Preaching. He muſt ſhew us, what relation Preaching hath to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Thus R. B. But in ſtead of any cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or ſo much as a confeſſion of this horrid abomination. Behold our Author <hi>Patroclus</hi> appears on the ſtage,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:102472:184"/>
ſometimes like a Petulant and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Gallant, with a laſcivious Fable in his mouth; And anone he is quite transformed into a right <hi>Hypo centaur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and breaths nothing but Blood, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Deſolation, pulling down Caſtles, overturning Fabricks, and cutting Juglar Veins: Yet never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets to extoll his brother <hi>I. B.</hi> And now and then to give us Paneygrick upon the mighty Acts performed by his Exorbitant <hi>Blatant Ribaldry,</hi> which is indeed all the Juſtice we can expect from that Generation.</p>
               <p>His Appendix I am not concerned with, being (as he ſaith) written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one <hi>Parker,</hi> whom he calls an <hi>Enthuſiaſtick Armenian;</hi> This name to ſome of his Hearers may ſerve for Goſpel to conjure the devil, but I will Engliſh it for them: <hi>It ſignifies a man inſpired of GOD, who believes the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Iames Arminius.</hi> I know no Men in this Nation who are under that denomination: But if I could find
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:102472:185"/>
one truely ſuch, I would prefer his Converſation to all the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the World, that deny the <hi>Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and tell us that <hi>Chriſt ſpoke his laſt words to his Church 1600 years ago:</hi> If he be alive, he will caſily anſwer for himſelf, if not, I hope his Brethren will vindicat him.</p>
               <p>To conclude the Presbyterian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is, <hi>That the Decrees of GOD are Eternal Purpoſe, according to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of His own Will, whereby for His own Glory he hath foreor dained whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver comes to paſs.</hi> According to which Doctrine, it is manifeſt, that all the Actions, Words, and Thoughts of Men are neceſſary, and that it is impoſſible for them to do, think, or ſpeak any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes then they do.</p>
               <p>And therefore I hope <hi>Patroclus</hi> and his Brethren cannot in Reaſon be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at me, for any thing I have writen in this Treatiſe, ſeeing, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own Doctrine, I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an invincible neceſſity to write

this, and no otherwiſe; Nor was it poſſible for me to forbear one Letter thereof.
